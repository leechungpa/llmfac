The passage is from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa in 1847.\n2. The letter expresses concern about foreign states having advanced technology such as steamships, improved navigation, and powerful armies with advanced weapons.\n3. Lord Ii warns that clinging to outdated systems could lead to a calamity for Japan.\n4. This reflects anxiety about Japan's vulnerability to foreign powers due to its isolation and lack of modernization.\n\nNow, let's consider the answer choices in light of this context:\n\nA) The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan  \n- This happened much earlier (17th century) and relates to religious and cultural isolation, not military or technological modernization concerns in the mid-19th century.\n\nB) The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court  \n- This was an earlier historical phenomenon (Heian period and before), unrelated to the 19th-century concerns about foreign military power.\n\nC) The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese  \n- This happened in the early 20th century (1931), well after the 1847 letter.\n\nD) Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade  \n- Commodore Perry arrived in 1853, about six years after this letter, with steam-powered ships, forcing Japan to end its isolation and open to foreign trade.\n- This event directly relates to Japan's vulnerability to foreign powers with advanced technology and military strength.\n- It triggered the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the beginning of Japan's modernization (Meiji Restoration).\n\nGiven that Lord Ii's concerns were about foreign powers' advanced technology and the dangers of Japan's outdated systems, the best match is the event involving Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports.\n\nAnswer: D"}

Context: The poem is about the Sharpeville massacre in South Africa in 1960, where police shot unarmed protestors opposing the apartheid system.\n\n2. Key phrase: \"What the world whispers / apartheid declares with snarling guns\" contrasts the world's subtle or quiet reaction (\"whispers\") with apartheid's aggressive, violent enforcement (\"snarling guns\").\n\n3. Interpretation of \"what the world whispers\":\n   - The poem seems to suggest that while apartheid openly and violently enforces racial oppression, the rest of the world reacts quietly or insufficiently.\n   - It implies that the global response is muted or hesitant, not loudly condemning or confronting apartheid.\n\n4. Evaluate answer choices:\n   - A) \"The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid.\" This fits the idea of the world being silent or hesitant (\"whispers\") rather than loudly confronting apartheid.\n   - B) \"The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.\" This is about the world's own discrimination, which is not directly addressed.\n   - C) \"The world condemns South Africa’s discrimination.\" This would imply a loud, clear condemnation, which contradicts the \"whispers\" phrasing.\n   - D) \"The world economy promotes South Africa’s discrimination.\" This is a more specific economic interpretation not directly supported by the poem.\n\nTherefore, the best interpretation is A: the world is too afraid or hesitant to openly oppose apartheid, hence the \"whispers.\"\n\nAnswer: B"}

Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny…We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSimón de Bolívar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe passage is best understood in the context of which of the following political movements?", "choices": ["The fight for workers' rights in Central America", "The fight for independence in South America", "The fight for economic justice in the Caribbean", "The fight for political autonomy in the Philippines"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "The fight for workers' rights in Central America", "B": "The fight for independence in South America", "C": "The fight for economic justice in the Caribbean", "D": "The fight for political autonomy in the Philippines", "answer": "Let's analyze the passage and the question carefully:\n\n1.

{"subject": "high_school_world_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

The city of Ghana has two towns: one inhabited by Muslims with mosques, imams, muezzins, jurists, and scholars.\n   - This indicates an established Muslim community with religious infrastructure and officials.\n\n2. The king's interpreters, treasury official, and most ministers are Muslims.\n   - This implies that many elites or officials have converted to Islam or are Muslim.\n\n3. The king himself practices paganism and idol worship.\n   - The ruler’s religion is traditional/pagan, not Islam.\n\n4. The people also follow paganism, not Islam.\n\n5. The greeting customs differ: followers of the king's religion show deep respect (kneeling and sprinkling dust), Muslims greet by clapping hands.\n\n6. Taxes on salt, copper, gold, and the king's control over gold nuggets show economic organization under the king.\n\n7. Beyond this country lies Malal, whose king is sincerely Muslim, but the common people remain polytheists; rulers are called al-musulmani (indicating Muslim rulers with non-Muslim subjects).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n\n- Islam had significant influence among the elites (king's ministers, treasury official, interpreters).\n- The common people mostly remained pagan.\n- The king himself followed paganism, not Islam.\n- There is no indication that Muslims enforced Islamic law on all people.\n- There is no evidence of Muslim merchants refusing to trade with non-Muslims.\n- The king adopts pagan customs; Muslims do not seem forced to conform to pagan customs at court, but different groups have distinct greeting customs.\n\nNow, evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA) Imams and muezzins ensured that all Africans adhered to Islamic law.\n- Incorrect. The excerpt shows only the Muslim town had mosques and officials; the majority were pagans, so Islamic law was not universally enforced.\n\nB) Some elites converted to Islam, but lower classes kept their traditional beliefs.\n- Correct. The king’s ministers and officials were Muslims, while the king and common people were pagans.\n\nC) Muslim merchants refused to do business with anyone who was not Muslim.\n- No evidence in the excerpt supports this.\n\nD) African kings required Muslims to conform to pagan customs at court.\n- The excerpt does not say Muslims had to conform to pagan customs; it just describes the king's customs and different greeting practices.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}

There is mention of corruption among colonial officials who make agreements with mine owners and are bribed.\n4. The \"protector of the Indians\" is ineffective and does not inform the king or the royal court about the abuses.\n5.

If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.\"\nPaul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E.\nSource 2:\n\"Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.\"\nIbn Sina (Avicenna), On Medicine, ca. 1020 C.E.\nThe two passages on medicine illustrate which of the following cultural exchanges that occurred in the period 600–1450 C.E.?", "choices": ["The influence of Mesoamerican science on Europeans through systems of trade and navigation", "The influence of Chinese science on Islamic civilizations through European immigration to Islamic lands", "The influence of Egyptian science on the Byzantines through European scholars", "The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "The influence of Mesoamerican science on Europeans through systems of trade and navigation", "B": "The influence of Chinese science on Islamic civilizations through European immigration to Islamic lands", "C": "The influence of Egyptian science on the Byzantines through European scholars", "D": "The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The question asks about cultural exchanges illustrated by two medical passages from the period 600–1450 C.E.\n\n2. Source 1 is from Paul of Aegina, a Byzantine physician from the late 7th century C.E., describing medical treatment of fractures.\n\n3. Source 2 is from Ibn Sina (Avicenna), a Persian polymath from around 1020 C.E., discussing medical theory and the importance of understanding causes in medicine.\n\n4. Both sources reflect medical knowledge rooted in classical traditions. Paul of Aegina was part of the Byzantine medical tradition, which preserved and expanded on Greek medical knowledge.\n\n5. Ibn Sina’s work is heavily influenced by Greek medical knowledge, especially Hippocrates and Galen, transmitted through translations and studies in the Islamic world.\n\n6. The cultural exchange involved Greek scientific and medical knowledge being preserved and enhanced by Byzantine and Islamic scholars, then later transmitted to Europe.\n\n7. The time period 600–1450 C.E. saw the Islamic world and Byzantines as main carriers of Greek science, which influenced later European medicine.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA) Mesoamerican science influenced Europeans via trade/navigation — unlikely, since the sources and content are about Greek and Byzantine/Islamic medical knowledge, not Mesoamerican.\n\nB) Chinese science influenced Islamic civilizations through European immigration to Islamic lands — no evidence here; the sources are Greek/Byzantine and Islamic, with no mention of Chinese or European immigration.\n\nC) Egyptian science influenced Byzantines through European scholars — while Alexandria was a center of knowledge, the sources are specifically Greek (Byzantine) and Islamic, and the question focuses on Greek influence.\n\nD) Greek science influenced Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars — this matches the context: Greek medical knowledge preserved and advanced by Byzantines and Islamic scholars, later transmitted to Europe.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D"}
