In other words, the additional output from each additional unit of labor is increasing.\n\n3. **Marginal product of labor (MPL)**: This is the additional output produced by one additional unit of labor. MPL is the slope of the total product curve.\n\n4. Since TPL is rising at an increasing rate, the slope of the TPL curve (which is MPL) is increasing.\n\n5. Therefore, the marginal product of labor must be rising.\n\n6. Option analysis:\n   - A) Marginal product of labor is rising. — aligns perfectly with the above reasoning.\n   - B) Marginal product of labor is at its minimum. — no, if MPL was at its minimum, TPL would be rising at a decreasing rate.\n   - C) Marginal product of labor is at its maximum. — no, if MPL was at its maximum, TPL would be increasing but the rate of increase would start to slow down after that.\n   - D) Marginal cost is rising. — marginal cost is generally inversely related to marginal product; if MPL is rising, marginal cost would be falling, so this is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: A"}

These variations can arise from several factors:\n\nA) Differences in human capital stock: Human capital includes education, skills, experience, and training. Workers with higher human capital typically earn higher wages. This is a well-known source of wage differentials.\n\nB) Racial or gender discrimination: Discrimination can lead to wage differences between groups even when they have similar productivity or human capital. This is also a recognized source of wage differentials.\n\nC) Immobility of workers: If workers cannot move freely between jobs or regions due to geographic, social, or legal barriers, this can cause wage differences. For example, workers in less desirable locations may earn less. Therefore, immobility contributes to wage differentials.\n\nD) Decrease in the birth rate: This is a demographic factor affecting population growth. While changes in birth rates can affect labor supply in the long term, a decrease in birth rate itself does not directly cause wage differentials among workers at a given time. It may influence the overall labor market but is not typically considered a source of wage differentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D"}
