However, a ring does not necessarily require multiplicative inverses or commutativity of multiplication.  \n- Since a field satisfies all ring axioms (it is a commutative ring with unity and multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements), every field is indeed a ring.  \n- Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n**Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.**  \n- A multiplicative identity (often denoted as 1) is an element such that for any element \\( a \\) in the ring, \\( a \\times 1 = 1 \\times a = a \\).  \n- However, not all rings are required to have a multiplicative identity. Rings without a multiplicative identity are called \"rngs\" (pronounced \"rings\" but spelled without the \"i\").  \n- Thus, it is not true that every ring has a multiplicative identity.  \n- Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\n**Combining the results:**  \n- Statement 1 is True.  \n- Statement 2 is False.\n\nHence, the correct option is C) True, False.\n\nAnswer: C"}
