{"subject": "high_school_mathematics", "category": "STEM", "question": "In Canada in 2014, the average wholesale price of soybeans was $0.24 per pound. In 2015, the average wholesale price of soybeans was $0.16 per pound. If a retailer purchased 20,000 pounds of soybeans in 2014 and in 2015, what was the percent change in the retailer’s expenses from 2014 to 2015?", "choices": ["–8%", "–33%", "–50%", "8%"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "–8%", "B": "–33%", "C": "–50%", "D": "8%", "answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Identify the prices and quantities:\n   - 2014 price per pound = $0.24\n   - 2015 price per pound = $0.16\n   - Quantity purchased in both years = 20,000 pounds\n\n2. Calculate the total expenses for each year:\n   - 2014 expenses = 20,000 pounds × $0.24/pound = $4,800\n   - 2015 expenses = 20,000 pounds × $0.16/pound = $3,200\n\n3. Calculate the change in expenses from 2014 to 2015:\n   - Change = 2015 expenses - 2014 expenses = $3,200 - $4,800 = -$1,600\n\n4. Calculate the percent change relative to 2014 expenses:\n   - Percent change = (Change / 2014 expenses) × 100\n   - Percent change = (-$1,600 / $4,800) × 100 = -33.33%\n\n5. The negative sign indicates a decrease.\n\nTherefore, the retailer’s expenses decreased by approximately 33%.\n\nAnswer: B"}
