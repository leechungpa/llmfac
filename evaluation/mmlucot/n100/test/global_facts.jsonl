The question asks for the median international income as of 2020.\n2. Median international income refers to the middle income value when all countries' incomes or individuals' incomes worldwide are arranged in order.\n3. Global income distribution is highly skewed, with many low-income countries and fewer high-income countries.\n4. As of 2020, global median income per capita is generally understood to be around $1,000, considering the large populations in low and middle-income countries.\n5. $300 is quite low and more typical of the poorest countries' per capita income.\n6. $10,000 and $30,000 are more representative of average incomes in high-income countries, not the median worldwide.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable estimate for median international income in 2020 is approximately $1,000.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Developed countries had higher literacy rates.\n\nStep 3: Estimate range - Given these factors, global literacy was significantly lower than today. Modern global literacy rates are above 80%, but in 1950, it was much lower.\n\nStep 4: Analyze options - \n- 96% is extremely high for 1950.\n- 76% might be too optimistic.\n- 56% seems reasonable.\n- 36% seems a bit low but possible.\n\nStep 5: Cross-check with known data - Historical data suggests global literacy was around 50-60% in mid 20th century.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is around 56%.\n\nAnswer: B"}
