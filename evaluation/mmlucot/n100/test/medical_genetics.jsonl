The most severe form (hydrops fetalis) occurs when all four alpha genes are deleted, leading to severe anemia even in utero and at birth. This condition is known for causing severe anemia at birth.\n\nB) Beta-thalassaemia: This disorder involves defects in beta-globin chain production. However, beta-globin synthesis starts after birth; fetal hemoglobin (which has gamma chains) predominates before birth. Therefore, beta-thalassemia typically does not cause severe anemia at birth but manifests after 3-6 months when beta chains are required.\n\nC) Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin: This condition is characterized by continued production of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood, generally benign and not associated with severe anemia.\n\nD) Sickle cell disease: Symptoms usually appear after 6 months of age when fetal hemoglobin declines and sickle hemoglobin predominates. Severe anemia is not typical at birth.\n\nConclusion: Severe anemia at birth is characteristic of severe alpha-thalassemia (especially hydrops fetalis).\n\nAnswer: A"}
{"subject": "medical_genetics", "category": "Other", "question": "The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is:", "choices": ["1%", "10%", "25%", "Almost 100%"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "1%", "B": "10%", "C": "25%", "D": "Almost 100%", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to accumulation of phenylalanine.\n2. If a mother has untreated PKU during pregnancy, high levels of phenylalanine cross the placenta and can cause fetal damage.\n3. This is known as maternal PKU syndrome, which can lead to congenital abnormalities in the child, including microcephaly, intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, and growth retardation.\n4. The risk of abnormalities is related to the maternal phenylalanine level during pregnancy rather than the child's genotype alone.\n5. If the mother is untreated, the risk of abnormalities in the child is very high, almost certain, because the teratogenic effect of phenylalanine is dose-dependent.\n6. Therefore, the risk is close to 100% if the mother is untreated.\n\nAnswer: D"}
