The ball’s speed is zero at the highest point.\n- When an object is tossed straight up, it slows down due to gravity until it momentarily stops at the highest point before falling back down.\n- Therefore, the speed at the highest point is zero.\n- So, statement I is true.\n\n2. The ball’s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n- Acceleration due to gravity acts downward at all points during the motion, regardless of the velocity or position.\n- Air resistance acts opposite to the direction of velocity, but at the highest point, velocity is zero, so air resistance is zero there.\n- However, gravity still acts downward, so acceleration is not zero at the highest point.\n- Therefore, statement II is false.\n\n3. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n- Without air resistance, the time to go up equals time to come down.\n- With air resistance (which acts opposite the velocity), the ball experiences greater drag going up (because velocity is upward and drag downward) than going down (velocity downward but drag upward).\n- This causes the ball to slow more on the way up, so it takes longer to ascend than to descend.\n- Thus, statement III is true.\n\nSummary:\n- I is true.\n- II is false.\n- III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D) I & III only.\n\nAnswer: C"}
