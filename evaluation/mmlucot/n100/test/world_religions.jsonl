The Muslims faced setbacks here.\n\nB) The Battle of Camel: This battle was a civil war fought after the death of Prophet Muhammad and is unrelated to the conversion of Mecca.\n\nC) The Battle of the Trench: Also known as the Battle of Khandaq, it was a siege on Medina by Meccan forces but did not directly result in the conversion of Mecca.\n\nD) The Battle of Badr: This was the first major battle between the Muslims and the Meccans and was a decisive victory for the Muslims. However, while it boosted Muslim morale and influence, it did not directly cause the conversion of Mecca.\n\nThe actual event leading to the conversion of Mecca was the peaceful conquest of Mecca by Prophet Muhammad and his followers in 630 CE after a series of treaties and negotiations, not a battle listed here.\n\nAmong the options given, none explicitly corresponds to the battle that led to the conversion of Mecca, but the closest significant battle that set the stage for the eventual conquest was the Battle of Badr, as it was the first major Muslim victory that shifted power dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the best answer in context is:\n\nAnswer: C"}
