Also, the question is about reviewing realities, not about creating a vision from scratch.\n\nB) to interpret trends for management  \n- This makes sense because reviewing present and future realities allows the PR counselor to identify and interpret trends (social, economic, industry-related) that can impact the organization, and then communicate these insights to management for strategic decisions.\n\nC) to interpret the organization's business plan  \n- While understanding the business plan is important, it is a static document that does not necessarily require continual review of present and future realities. Also, interpreting a business plan is more about understanding internal strategy than external realities.\n\nD) to consider the role public relations might play  \n- This is also a reasonable option because by reviewing realities, the PR counselor can determine how PR efforts could support the organization’s goals in the current and future context.\n\nBetween B and D, both seem plausible. However, the question asks \"Why should a successful PR counselor continually review present and future realities?\" The ongoing review is primarily to interpret external and internal trends and realities that affect the organization, which is closely aligned with option B. Option D seems more focused on applying the review findings specifically to PR's role, but the broader purpose is to interpret trends for management to make informed decisions.\n\nHence, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}

The peer is giving a brief piece of advice that describes the foundation of their successful program.\n\n3. **Analyzing each choice:**\n\n   - **A) Solve their problems:**  \n     This suggests addressing the concerns and issues of the community, offering solutions that alleviate their worries. This approach is constructive, collaborative, and likely to build trust and goodwill.\n\n   - **B) Kill them with kindness:**  \n     This is a phrase meaning to be very kind to opponents, hoping to disarm opposition through politeness and friendliness. While nice, it might not be enough alone if concerns are substantive.\n\n   - **C) Expose them to ridicule:**  \n     This is a negative, confrontational tactic, likely to alienate people and escalate opposition rather than resolve it.\n\n   - **D) Overwhelm them with facts:**  \n     While facts are important, simply overwhelming opponents with data may backfire if it doesn’t address their emotional or value-based concerns.\n\n4. **Best choice:**  \n   The most effective foundation for a successful communication program with community opposition is to understand and solve their problems, addressing their concerns directly. This builds trust and shows respect for their viewpoints.\n\nHence, the peer's succinct advice is most likely to be:\n\n**\"Solve their problems.\"**\n\nAnswer: A"}
