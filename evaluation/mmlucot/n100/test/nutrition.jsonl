{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "Inviduals suffering from inhalant allergies may also react to cross- reacting food allergens. A person suffering from a natural latex allergy might not react to one of the following allergens\n", "choices": ["avocado", "mango", "peach", "figs"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "avocado", "B": "mango", "C": "peach", "D": "figs", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The topic is about cross-reactivity between inhalant allergies and food allergens.\n2. The specific allergy mentioned is a natural latex allergy.\n3. We need to identify which of the listed food allergens a person with a natural latex allergy might NOT react to.\n4. Natural latex allergy is known to cross-react with certain fruits due to similar proteins. This is called latex-fruit syndrome.\n5. Common fruits involved in latex-fruit syndrome include avocado, banana, mango, chestnut, and sometimes figs.\n6. The options given are avocado, mango, peach, and figs.\n7. Avocado, mango, and figs are well-documented for cross-reactivity with latex.\n8. Peach, however, is less commonly associated with latex allergy cross-reactivity; it is more often linked to pollen allergies (birch pollen and others) but not strongly with latex.\n   \nTherefore, a person with natural latex allergy might NOT react to peach among these options.\n\nAnswer: D"}
{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "Fats normally contain triacylglycerols at concentrations of:\n", "choices": ["75-95%", "50- 75%", "> 95%", "< 50%"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "75-95%", "B": "50- 75%", "C": "> 95%", "D": "< 50%", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The question asks about the typical concentration of triacylglycerols (also called triglycerides) in fats.\n\n2. Triacylglycerols are the main components of fats and oils. They are esters derived from glycerol and three fatty acids.\n\n3. In most natural fats and oils, triacylglycerols make up the majority of the composition, usually more than 90%.\n\n4. Minor components in fats include free fatty acids, phospholipids, sterols, and other lipids, but these are generally present in much smaller amounts.\n\n5. Considering this, the concentration of triacylglycerols in fats is typically very high, commonly greater than 95%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nAnswer: C"}
