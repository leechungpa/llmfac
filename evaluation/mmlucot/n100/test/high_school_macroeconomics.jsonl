The increase in consumption is typically a fraction of the increase in disposable income, and the rest is saved.\n\n4. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) and Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS):**  \n   - MPC is the fraction of additional income that is spent (consumed).  \n   - MPS is the fraction of additional income that is saved.  \n   Since MPC + MPS = 1, if disposable income increases by $X, consumption increases by MPC × $X, and saving increases by MPS × $X.\n\n5. **Evaluating the options:**\n   - A) consumption increases by more than $X: This is unlikely because consumption cannot increase by more than the additional disposable income itself.\n   - B) saving increases by less than $X: This seems correct because saving is typically a fraction (MPS) of the increase in income, so saving increases by less than $X.\n   - C) saving increases by exactly $X: This would mean all additional income is saved, which is unlikely.\n   - D) saving remains constant: This is incorrect because saving should increase with higher disposable income.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}

They are assets for the bank because they are reserves held at the central bank or as cash.\n\n2. **Excess Reserves**: These are reserves held by the bank beyond the required minimum. Like required reserves, excess reserves are assets because they represent funds available to the bank.\n\n3. **Loans**: Loans are amounts the bank has lent out to customers. From the bank's perspective, loans are assets because they represent money the bank expects to receive back with interest.\n\n4. **Deposits**: Deposits are money that customers have placed in the bank. These are liabilities because the bank owes this money back to the depositors on demand or at maturity.\n\nTherefore, the item that is considered a liability on a bank's balance sheet is **Deposits**.\n\nAnswer: D"}
