{"subject": "high_school_statistics", "category": "STEM", "question": "An automobile service station performs oil changes and tire replacements, as well as other services. Sixty percent of its customers request an oil change, 30 percent request tire replacements, and 10 percent request both. A customer requests an oil change. What is the probability this customer does not request tire replacements?", "choices": ["0.42", "0.5", "0.7", "0.833"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "0.42", "B": "0.5", "C": "0.7", "D": "0.833", "answer": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given probabilities related to customers requesting services:\n   - P(O) = Probability a customer requests an oil change = 0.60\n   - P(T) = Probability a customer requests tire replacements = 0.30\n   - P(O âˆ© T) = Probability a customer requests both oil change and tire replacements = 0.10\n\n2. The question asks: Given that a customer requests an oil change, what is the probability that this customer does *not* request tire replacements?\n\n3. This is a conditional probability question. We want to find:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{no tire replacement} \\mid \\text{oil change}) = 1 - P(\\text{tire replacement} \\mid \\text{oil change})\n   \\]\n\n4. Use the definition of conditional probability:\n   \\[\n   P(T \\mid O) = \\frac{P(O \\cap T)}{P(O)} = \\frac{0.10}{0.60} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667\n   \\]\n\n5. Therefore, the probability that a customer requests an oil change but does *not* request tire replacements is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.1667 = 0.8333\n   \\]\n\n6. Among the given options, 0.833 is the closest and correct answer.\n\nAnswer: D"}
