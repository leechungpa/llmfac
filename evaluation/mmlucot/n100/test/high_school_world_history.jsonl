The excerpt is from Ibn Battuta's travels in the 14th century, describing Mongol-ruled China:\n   - Mongol rule in China (Yuan Dynasty) was religiously tolerant: various religious groups (Muslims, Jews, Christians, etc.) had their own communities, places of worship, and were treated with respect.\n   - The Mongols in China maintained a complex, bureaucratic, and cosmopolitan administration.\n   - The city of Hangzhou is described as well-organized, with diverse religious groups coexisting, and the Mongols apparently integrated into the existing Chinese bureaucratic structure.\n\n2. The question asks how Mongol administration of Russia differed from Mongol administration in China during roughly the same period (600 CE to 1450 CE):\n   - Mongols ruled Russia through the Golden Horde.\n   - Mongol rule in Russia is known for heavy tribute extraction from the Russian principalities.\n   - Unlike in China, the Mongols did not attempt to impose a Chinese-style bureaucratic state in Russia; governance was more indirect.\n   - Russian Orthodox Christianity was generally tolerated, but the Mongols did not show the same level of religious pluralism as in China.\n   - Mongol rule in Russia was often seen as oppressive, with heavy taxation and less favorable views from the subjects.\n   - There was trade between Russia and China, but the Mongols in Russia did not particularly stimulate Russian exports to China, nor did they curtail Chinese economic activity (which was largely independent).\n\n3. Analyzing the options:\n   - A) \"was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions\"\n     This aligns with the known difference: Mongols in Russia mainly tolerated Orthodox Christianity, and were less pluralistic compared to China.\n   \n   - B) \"relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state\"\n     This is also true: Mongols in Russia extracted tribute; in China, they kept a bureaucratic system.\n   \n   - C) \"was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\"\n     This is false; Mongol rule in Russia was generally resented; China had some unrest but also complex governance.\n   \n   - D) \"stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity\"\n     This is false; Mongols in China did not curtail economic activity but often promoted trade.\n\n4. Both A and B are factually accurate, but the question asks how \"Mongol administration of its Russian domains differed in that...,\" so the best answer highlights a key administrative difference.\n\nBetween A and B:\n- A focuses on religious tolerance differences.\n- B focuses on administrative style and economic extraction.\n\nGiven the excerpt emphasizes religious tolerance, but the question is about administration differences, B is a stronger answer because it highlights the administrative methods (tribute vs. bureaucracy) which are clear and major differences.\n\nAnswer: B"}

The passage is from the Upanishads, which are ancient Indian texts associated with Hindu philosophy, dating to around 1000 BCE.\n\n2. The passage speaks of \"the Spirit that is in my heart,\" called \"Brahman,\" which \"enfolds the whole universe\" and to whom one goes \"when I go beyond this life.\" This implies a belief in some form of afterlife or continuation beyond death.\n\n3. The text mentions faith and doubt (\"to him will come he who has faith and doubts not\"), indicating that belief or faith is important.\n\nNow, analyze each option:\n\nA) Salvation is based on the correct completion of rituals.\n- The passage doesn't mention rituals or their completion as the path to salvation. It emphasizes faith and the Spirit/Brahman. While Hinduism has rituals, the Upanishads tend to focus more on knowledge and realization than ritualism.\n\nB) There is an expectation of an afterlife.\n- The passage mentions \"to him I shall come when I go beyond this life,\" which clearly implies belief in life after death or some form of afterlife.\n\nC) Right actions and right speech earn favor with the gods.\n- The passage doesn't mention actions or speech earning favor. It emphasizes faith and the Spirit.\n\nD) It is a polytheistic religion.\n- Hinduism is often described as polytheistic, but the Upanishads focus on Brahman, the ultimate, universal spirit, which is more monistic or pantheistic. The passage emphasizes one Spirit that enfolds the universe, not many gods.\n\nConclusion: The statement that best fits the passage is (B), as the passage clearly suggests belief in an afterlife.\n\nAnswer: B"}
