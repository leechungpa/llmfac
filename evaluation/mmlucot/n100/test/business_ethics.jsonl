The areas these tools typically cover include compliance, corruption, and environmental issues. These tools are evolving, and recently, the focus (\"onus\") on something specific has grown.\n\nStep 1: Identify the business ethics management tool that fits this description.\n\n- Annual reports are reports issued by companies summarizing financial and other information. While they may include some ethics-related disclosures, they are primarily financial documents.\n- Codes of ethics are formal documents that outline an organization's values and ethical standards. They directly relate to business ethics management.\n  \nGiven that compliance, corruption, and environmental issues are typical areas covered by ethics management tools, \"codes of ethics\" fit better than \"annual reports.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second blank, the area with growing onus.\n\n- Company financial performance is a standard business concern but not directly linked to ethics management tools.\n- Internet - social media and networking have grown substantially in recent years and present new ethical challenges, including privacy, data use, misinformation, etc.\n\nTherefore, the onus on Internet-related issues in ethics management has grown in recent years.\n\nStep 3: Match the correct pair.\n\n- A) Annual reports, Company financial performance — Not fitting since annual reports are not primarily ethics tools.\n- B) Annual report, Internet - social media and networking — Same issue.\n- C) Codes of ethics, Company financial performance — Codes of ethics fit, but financial performance is not the new onus.\n- D) Codes of ethics, Internet - social media and networking — This fits perfectly.\n\nAnswer: D"}
