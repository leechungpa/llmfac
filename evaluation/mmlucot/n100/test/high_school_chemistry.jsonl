{"subject": "high_school_chemistry", "category": "STEM", "question": "The weight percent of sodium hydroxide dissolved in water is 50%. What is the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide?", "choices": ["31.00%", "0.164", "0.311", "0.5"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "31.00%", "B": "0.164", "C": "0.311", "D": "0.5", "answer": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given:**\n   - Weight percent (wt%) of NaOH in solution = 50%\n   - This means 50 g of NaOH is dissolved in 50 g of water (since the total solution is 100 g).\n\n2. **Find mole fraction of NaOH:**\n   - Mole fraction is defined as:\n     \\[\n     X_{\\text{NaOH}} = \\frac{\\text{moles of NaOH}}{\\text{moles of NaOH} + \\text{moles of water}}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate moles of NaOH:**\n   - Molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol\n   - Moles of NaOH = \\(\\frac{50 \\text{ g}}{40 \\text{ g/mol}} = 1.25 \\text{ mol}\\)\n\n4. **Calculate moles of water:**\n   - Mass of water = 50 g\n   - Molar mass of water = 18 g/mol\n   - Moles of water = \\(\\frac{50 \\text{ g}}{18 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 2.78 \\text{ mol}\\)\n\n5. **Calculate mole fraction:**\n   \\[\n   X_{\\text{NaOH}} = \\frac{1.25}{1.25 + 2.78} = \\frac{1.25}{4.03} \\approx 0.31\n   \\]\n\n6. **Compare with options:**\n   - 0.311 is very close to the calculated value 0.31.\n\nHence, the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide is approximately 0.311.\n\nAnswer: C"}
