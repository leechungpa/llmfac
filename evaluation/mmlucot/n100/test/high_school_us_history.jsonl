But we do not have the right to resort to violence—or the threat of violence—when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government…was a threat to me. Everything that Waco implies was on the forefront of my thoughts. That sort of guided my path for the next couple of years.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City bomber, 2001\nU.S. Representative John Conyers, Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas: Hearing Before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 1993\nIn the third excerpt, Representative Conyers refers to \"Wounded Knee\" as an example of", "choices": ["a violent cult", "a federal misuse of power", "the site of a bombing", "a recent conflict between federal agents and Lakota Indians"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "a violent cult", "B": "a federal misuse of power", "C": "the site of a bombing", "D": "a recent conflict between federal agents and Lakota Indians", "answer": "Step 1: Understand the question context.\n- The question asks about the third excerpt, which references \"Wounded Knee.\"\n- The third excerpt is from a hearing by Rep.

{"subject": "high_school_us_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nClearly, no longer can a dictator count on East–West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.\n—President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990\nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush's vision of a \"new world order\" was most directly made possible by", "choices": ["American economic prosperity.", "President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.", "the Iranian Hostage Crisis.", "the end of the Cold War."], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "American economic prosperity.", "B": "President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.", "C": "the Iranian Hostage Crisis.", "D": "the end of the Cold War.", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The question asks about President George H.W. Bush's vision of a \"new world order,\" as stated in his 1990 speech.\n2. The speech mentions \"no longer can a dictator count on East–West confrontation\" and a \"new partnership of nations,\" indicating a change from the previous global tension.\n3. The \"East–West confrontation\" refers to the Cold War rivalry between the Soviet Union (East) and the United States (West).\n4. The new world order Bush envisions is based on cooperation among nations, moving beyond the Cold War conflicts.\n5. Therefore, the key factor that made this vision possible was the end of the Cold War, which removed the bipolar global tension and allowed for greater international cooperation.\n6. The other options:\n   - A) American economic prosperity: While important, it is not the direct cause of the new world order concept.\n   - B) Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative: This was a missile defense program, but not directly related to the new world order vision.\n   - C) The Iranian Hostage Crisis: This event, occurring in 1979-81, did not create the conditions for the new world order.\n   \nThus, the correct answer is D) the end of the Cold War.\n\nAnswer: D"}
