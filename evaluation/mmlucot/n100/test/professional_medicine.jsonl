{"subject": "professional_medicine", "category": "Other", "question": "A 40-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia is transferred to the emergency department from the residential facility where he lives 2 hours after having swallowed a nail. The patient says he does not have any symptoms. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. His only current medication is haloperidol. The patient is not in acute distress. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination discloses a flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts. X-ray of the abdomen is obtained and shows a 4-cm nail in the left upper quadrant. No free air is visible. After admitting the patient to the hospital, which of the following is the most appropriate management?", "choices": ["Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting and expectoration of the nail", "Observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis", "Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision", "Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting and expectoration of the nail", "B": "Observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis", "C": "Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision", "D": "Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy", "answer": "Let's analyze the clinical scenario and options step by step.\n\n1. Patient details:\n- 40-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia.\n- Swallowed a 4-cm nail 2 hours ago.\n- Currently asymptomatic.\n- Vital signs normal.\n- Physical exam normal.\n- X-ray shows nail in left upper quadrant, no free air (no perforation).\n- On haloperidol.\n- Mental status: flat affect, distractibility, derailment.\n\n2. Clinical considerations:\n- The nail is a sharp foreign body, 4 cm long, located in the left upper quadrant (likely in the stomach).\n- Sharp foreign bodies pose a risk of perforation or obstruction.\n- The patient is currently asymptomatic with no signs of perforation (no free air on X-ray).\n- The nail is too large and sharp to be expected to pass safely through the GI tract.\n- Sharp foreign bodies longer than 2-3 cm generally need to be removed to prevent complications.\n- The left upper quadrant location suggests the nail is in the stomach or possibly the distal esophagus.\n\n3. Management options:\n\nA) Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting:\n- Inducing vomiting with sharp foreign bodies is contraindicated because it may cause mucosal injury or perforation.\n- Also, ipecac use is generally discouraged due to risks and lack of efficacy.\n\nB) Observation to allow passage via peristalsis:\n- Observation may be reasonable for small, blunt objects.\n- Sharp objects longer than 2-3 cm carry a higher risk of complications.\n- Nails are sharp and can perforate the GI tract.\n- Observation alone is usually not recommended.\n\nC) Open laparotomy and removal via gastrotomy:\n- This is a surgical approach.\n- Surgery is typically reserved for cases with complications (perforation, obstruction) or when endoscopic removal fails or is not feasible.\n- The patient currently has no signs of complications.\n- Surgery is invasive and usually avoided if less invasive methods are possible.\n\nD) Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy:\n- Endoscopic removal is the preferred first-line treatment for sharp foreign bodies in the esophagus or stomach.\n- It is less invasive than surgery.\n- It reduces risk of perforation and other complications.\n- Given the nail is in the stomach (left upper quadrant) and the patient is stable, endoscopic removal is indicated.\n\nConclusion:\nThe most appropriate management is endoscopic removal of the nail via esophagogastroscopy.\n\nAnswer: D"}
{"subject": "professional_medicine", "category": "Other", "question": "A 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung is admitted to the hospital to undergo chemotherapy. Six days after treatment is started, she develops a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100/mm3 (5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes). Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count?", "choices": ["Darbepoetin", "Dexamethasone", "Filgrastim", "Interferon alfa"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "Darbepoetin", "B": "Dexamethasone", "C": "Filgrastim", "D": "Interferon alfa", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. Patient: 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n2. Clinical scenario: She has undergone chemotherapy.\n3. Current problem: Six days after chemotherapy, she develops a fever of 38°C (100.4°F).\n4. Lab findings: Leukocyte count is 100/mm³, which is extremely low (normal is roughly 4,000-11,000/mm³). The differential shows 5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes, indicating severe neutropenia.\n5. Interpretation: This patient has febrile neutropenia, a common and serious complication after chemotherapy due to bone marrow suppression.\n6. Goal: Increase leukocyte count, especially neutrophils, to reduce risk of infection.\n\nNow consider the treatment options:\n\nA) Darbepoetin: This is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia by stimulating red blood cell production. It does not increase white blood cells.\n\nB) Dexamethasone: A corticosteroid that can suppress inflammation and immune response. It is not used to increase leukocyte count and can actually cause leukocytosis by demargination but not effective in treating neutropenia from chemotherapy.\n\nC) Filgrastim: This is a recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). It stimulates the bone marrow to produce neutrophils, used specifically to treat neutropenia after chemotherapy.\n\nD) Interferon alfa: Used mainly for certain viral infections and some cancers. It does not increase neutrophil counts and can cause bone marrow suppression.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient’s leukocyte (particularly neutrophil) count after chemotherapy is filgrastim.\n\nAnswer: C"}
