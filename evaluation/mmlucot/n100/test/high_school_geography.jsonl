The question asks which capital city is located outside the central core area of its country.\n2. The \"central core area\" usually refers to the main economic, political, or population center of a country, often the historical or traditional heartland.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\nA) Abuja, Nigeria:\n- Abuja is the capital of Nigeria.\n- Originally, Lagos was the main economic and population center.\n- Abuja was purposefully built and designated as the capital in the central part of Nigeria to be more neutral and accessible.\n- It is located more centrally but not in the traditional core area dominated by Lagos in the south.\n\nB) Paris, France:\n- Paris is the capital and clearly the central core of France.\n- It is the main political, economic, and cultural center.\n- So Paris is definitely inside the central core area.\n\nC) London, United Kingdom:\n- London is the capital and the primary core city of the UK.\n- It is the economic, political, and cultural heart of the country.\n- So London is inside the central core area.\n\nD) Cairo, Egypt:\n- Cairo is the capital and the largest city of Egypt.\n- It lies in the Nile Delta, which is the central and most populated area of Egypt.\n- So Cairo is inside the central core area.\n\nTherefore, the only capital city that is located outside the traditional central core area of its country is Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nAnswer: A"}

The question is about a theory related to economic development of societies.\n2. The theory states that every society develops economically through a five-stage pattern of growth.\n3. We need to identify which scholar or theorist is attributed to this theory.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA) Rostow: Walt Whitman Rostow is known for his \"Stages of Economic Growth\" model, which outlines five stages through which societies develop economically. The stages are traditional society, preconditions for take-off, take-off, drive to maturity, and age of high mass consumption.\n\nB) Ravenstein: Ernst Ravenstein is known for his laws of migration, not economic growth stages.\n\nC) von Th端nen: Johann Heinrich von Th端nen is famous for his model of agricultural land use, focusing on the location of farming activities relative to markets.\n\nD) Burgess: Ernest Burgess developed the concentric zone model of urban land use, not economic development stages.\n\nGiven this, the theory describing economic development in five stages aligns with Rostow's model.\n\nAnswer: A"}
