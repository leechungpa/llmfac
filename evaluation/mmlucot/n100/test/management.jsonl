{"subject": "management", "category": "Other", "question": "Which one of the following is not a characteristic of a team?", "choices": ["Minimal and formal knowledge sharing", "Collective output", "Individual and collective responsibility", "Fluid dimension to roles and tasks"], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "Minimal and formal knowledge sharing", "B": "Collective output", "C": "Individual and collective responsibility", "D": "Fluid dimension to roles and tasks", "answer": "Let's analyze each option to determine which is not a characteristic of a team.\n\nA) Minimal and formal knowledge sharing  \n- In teams, knowledge sharing is typically encouraged and often informal to facilitate collaboration. Minimal and formal knowledge sharing implies limited and rigid communication, which contradicts the open communication typical of effective teams.\n\nB) Collective output  \n- Teams produce a collective output by working together toward a common goal. This is a defining characteristic of teams.\n\nC) Individual and collective responsibility  \n- In teams, both individual members and the team as a whole share responsibility for outcomes. This dual responsibility is typical of teams.\n\nD) Fluid dimension to roles and tasks  \n- Teams often have flexible roles and tasks to adapt to changing conditions and leverage members' strengths. This fluidity is common in team dynamics.\n\nFrom this analysis, option A is not a characteristic of a team because teams generally have open, frequent, and informal knowledge sharing rather than minimal and formal.\n\nAnswer: A"}
