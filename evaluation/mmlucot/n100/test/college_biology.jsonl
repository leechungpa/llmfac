The question asks for a biological attribute that would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution. \n   - Cosmopolitan distribution means the species is found widely across many geographical regions and various habitats.\n\n2. Consider the options:\n\n   A) Extreme habitat specialization:\n   - If a species is an extreme habitat specialist, it thrives only in very specific conditions.\n   - This specialization usually limits the species to certain areas and reduces its geographical spread.\n   - Therefore, this would likely restrict cosmopolitan distribution rather than enable it.\n\n   B) K-selected reproductive rate:\n   - K-selected species typically have slower reproduction, produce fewer offspring, and invest more in parental care.\n   - This strategy is often advantageous in stable environments but may limit rapid spread.\n   - This reproductive strategy does not strongly promote wide, cosmopolitan distribution.\n\n   C) Limited dispersal abilities:\n   - If a species has limited dispersal abilities, it cannot spread far from its origin.\n   - This would restrict its geographical distribution.\n   - Hence, it is unlikely to become cosmopolitan.\n\n   D) Capacity for long-distance dispersal:\n   - A species that can disperse its seeds, offspring, or propagules over long distances can colonize new areas widely.\n   - This ability is a key factor in becoming cosmopolitan because it allows the species to spread across different regions and habitats.\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   - The attribute that most likely allows a species to become cosmopolitan is the capacity for long-distance dispersal.\n\nAnswer: D"}
