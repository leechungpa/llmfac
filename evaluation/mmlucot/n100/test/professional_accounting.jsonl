{"subject": "professional_accounting", "category": "Other", "question": "Decker a 62-year-old single individual sold his principal residence for the net amount of $500000 after all selling expenses. Decker bought the house 15 years ago and occupied it until it was sold. On the date of sale the house had a cost basis of $200000. Within six months Decker purchased a new house for $600000. What amount of gain should Decker recognize from the sale of the residence?", "choices": ["$0", "$50,000", "$175,000", "300000"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "$0", "B": "$50,000", "C": "$175,000", "D": "300000", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step-by-step:\n\n1. **Information given:**\n   - Decker is 62 years old, single.\n   - Sold principal residence for net $500,000 after selling expenses.\n   - Purchased the house 15 years ago.\n   - Cost basis of the house at sale: $200,000.\n   - Decker occupied the house as principal residence until it was sold.\n   - Within six months, Decker purchased a new house for $600,000.\n\n2. **Relevant tax rules:**\n   - Under U.S. tax law, gain from the sale of a principal residence can be excluded up to $250,000 if the owner meets the ownership and use tests:\n     - Ownership test: owned the home for at least 2 years.\n     - Use test: lived in the home as principal residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years.\n   - Decker has owned and lived in the house for 15 years, so he qualifies for the exclusion.\n   - Since Decker is single, the maximum exclusion is $250,000.\n   - The amount of gain recognized = Sale price - Cost basis - Exclusion.\n\n3. **Calculate the gain:**\n   - Gain = $500,000 (sale price) - $200,000 (cost basis) = $300,000.\n\n4. **Apply exclusion:**\n   - Exclude $250,000 because Decker qualifies.\n   - Recognized gain = $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.\n\n5. **Note about buying a new house:**\n   - The purchase of a new house within six months does not affect the exclusion of gain for principal residence sales under current tax law (post-1997). The \"rollover\" rule was eliminated. So this purchase does not reduce the recognized gain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDecker should recognize a gain of $50,000.\n\nAnswer: B"}
