The term \"secondary deviation\" comes from labeling theory in sociology, particularly associated with Edwin Lemert.\n2. Primary deviation refers to the initial act of rule-breaking, which might not result in a person being labeled as deviant.\n3. Secondary deviation occurs when a person accepts the deviant label and begins to act in accordance with it; it involves the social reaction and internalization of the deviant identity.\n4. Option A: \"the punishment or stigmatization of deviant acts\" relates to social reaction and consequences of deviance, which is part of the process leading to secondary deviation.\n5. Option B: \"the labelling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it\" is about the social process that leads to labeling, which is a precondition to secondary deviation.\n6. Option C: \"the ways in which taking on a deviant role affects future action\" aligns closely with secondary deviation, where the individual internalizes the label and this influences their future behavior.\n7. Since secondary deviation involves social reactions, labeling, and the consequences of adopting a deviant identity, all these elements are interconnected.\n8. Therefore, the best answer is D) all of the above, as they collectively describe aspects related to secondary deviation.\n\nAnswer: D"}

The question is about the concept of \"normalizing\" a deviant act in sociology.\n2. Deviant acts are behaviors that violate social norms.\n3. If a deviant act is \"normalized,\" this means it is no longer seen as deviant or abnormal by society.\n4. Let's evaluate the options:\n   - A) \"Recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour\": This means the act is still seen as deviant, which contradicts the idea of normalization.\n   - B) \"Seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character\": This implies the deviance is an exception, not normalized.\n   - C) \"The first step in establishing a deviant career\": This refers to labeling theory and the process of becoming deviant, but normalization means the act is accepted, not a step toward deviance.\n   - D) \"Attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make-up\": This is a biological explanation of deviance, unrelated to normalization.\n\nNormalization in sociology means that the deviant behavior is accepted or viewed as normal within a social context.\n\nAnswer: None of the above options exactly describe normalization as acceptance or acceptance of the behavior as normal. However, the closest is that the act ceases to be seen as deviant and becomes accepted, which is not explicitly stated here. \n\nGiven the options, none perfectly fit, but if we interpret \"normalized\" as the act no longer being seen as deviant, then none of the options fit well.\n\nSince the question asks \"If a deviant act is 'normalized', it is:\", the best choice would be the one that reflects acceptance or non-deviance, but none do.\n\nIn this case, the best answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the provided options correctly define normalization of a deviant act. However, if forced to choose the closest, it would be A, but A contradicts normalization.\n\nAlternatively, the best fit is that normalization means the behavior is no longer seen as deviant, which is not represented by any answer.\n\nSince the question seems to be from a multiple-choice format with only these options, the best answer based on standard sociology understanding is:\n\nAnswer: None of the above.\n\nBut since this is not an option, the closest is:\n\nAnswer: B) seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character\n\nBecause normalization implies the deviant act is no longer permanently deviant, and might be temporarily deviant or acceptable.\n\nBut this is not a perfect fit.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: B"}
