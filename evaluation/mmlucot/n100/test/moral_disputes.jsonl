Huemer argues against drug prohibition on the grounds that it violates individual liberty.\n2. He acknowledges that drug use can potentially cause harm, but the primary justification for prohibition requires that the harm be direct, significant, and certain enough to override liberty.\n3. If drug use harms others indirectly (friends, family), Huemer questions whether this justifies prohibition.\n4. Huemer tends to argue that indirect harms or harms that are not certain or direct do not justify coercive laws.\n5. Therefore, even if drug use harms others, this alone would not justify prohibition unless the harm is direct and sufficiently likely.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nA) \"this would still not justify drug prohibition.\"  \n- This aligns with Huemer’s emphasis on individual liberty and skepticism about indirect harms justifying prohibition.\n\nB) \"this would justify drug prohibition.\"  \n- This seems too broad and likely contradicts Huemer's principle.\n\nC) \"this would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was extremely likely to cause these harms.\"  \n- This introduces a likelihood condition. Huemer might consider likelihood, but the question focuses on even if harms exist, so probably not exactly this.\n\nD) \"this would only justify drug prohibition if drug use was more likely to cause these kinds of harms than other prohibited activity.\"  \n- This comparative condition seems less central to Huemer's argument.\n\nGiven Huemer’s libertarian stance and skepticism towards prohibitions justified by indirect harms, option A fits best.\n\nAnswer: A"}

The question is about Hardin's view on the proposal to establish world food banks to help those in need.\n2. Garrett Hardin is famous for his essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" where he argues that common resources tend to be overused and depleted because individuals act in their own self-interest.\n3. Hardin was skeptical about collective solutions like shared resources without restrictions, as these often lead to overuse and eventual ruin.\n4. The world food bank proposal involves a shared resource or collective food supply to help those in need.\n5. Hardin would likely warn that such a system could be vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons, where unrestricted use leads to depletion.\n6. Option A says the operation must be conducted consistently; this is vague and doesn't capture Hardin's main concern.\n7. Option B says only richer countries have moral obligations; Hardin's argument is more about resource management than moral obligations by wealth.\n8. Option C says it would be subject to the tragedy of the commons, which aligns directly with Hardin's theory.\n9. Option D appeals to compassion and moral obligation, which is less consistent with Hardin's pragmatic, ecological approach.\n\nTherefore, the best answer that aligns with Hardin's perspective is:\n\nAnswer: C"}
