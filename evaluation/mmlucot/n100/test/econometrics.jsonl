While MSE is a common measure of forecast accuracy, it is not necessarily \"highly correlated with trading rule profitability.\" Trading profitability depends on more than forecast accuracy aloneâ€”it depends on the size and timing of errors, transaction costs, etc. So this statement is likely false.\n\nB) Mean absolute error (MAE) is the average of the absolute differences between forecasted and actual values. MAE corresponds to a linear (absolute value) loss function, not a quadratic loss function. Quadratic loss corresponds to MSE. So this statement is false.\n\nC) Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) measures the average absolute percentage difference between forecasted and actual values. MAPE is often criticized for being problematic with asset returns because returns can be zero or negative, making percentage errors undefined or misleading. Therefore, MAPE is generally not a good measure for asset return forecasts. So this statement is false.\n\nD) Mean squared error penalizes large forecast errors more than small errors because errors are squared, so larger errors contribute disproportionately more to the overall MSE. This characteristic is well-known and true.\n\nHence, the true statement is D.\n\nAnswer: D"}
