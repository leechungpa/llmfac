Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?", "choices": ["De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.", "Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.", "Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.", "De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas."], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.", "B": "Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.", "C": "Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.", "D": "De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.", "answer": "Let's analyze the two sources:\n\nSource 1 (Columbus) describes the natives as generous and somewhat naive in bartering, and Columbus presents himself as kind and generous, giving goods without expecting anything in return to win favor and convert them to Christianity. He portrays the relationship as relatively positive and amicable.\n\nSource 2 (de las Casas) paints a very grim picture, describing the Spaniards as brutal predators who massacred and tortured the indigenous population, leading to a catastrophic decline in their numbers. He condemns the Spaniards' greed and cruelty.\n\nNow, the question asks: Which explanation best accounts for the differences between these accounts?\n\nOption A: De las Casas exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n- De las Casas actually argued against the enslavement of indigenous peoples and advocated for African slavery as an alternative to protect natives. But the question is about why their descriptions differ, and exaggeration to support African slavery is not the main reason for the difference.\n\nOption B: Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n- Columbus had a vested interest in portraying his expedition positively to secure royal support. His account seems to downplay negative aspects and emphasize his own benevolence. This could explain the more favorable and optimistic tone.\n\nOption C: Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than later expeditions.\n- While this is possible, historical evidence shows that violence and exploitation began early and escalated, but Columbus himself initiated harsh treatment. So this option is less likely to explain the difference.\n\nOption D: De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n- De las Casas was critical of Spanish abuses, but his goal was more to reform Spanish treatment of natives, not necessarily to have them leave the Americas entirely.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that Columbus's account is biased in favor of himself, highlighting positive interactions and minimizing abuses, while de las Casas provides a critical, condemnatory account.\n\nAnswer: B"}

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . .

Also, the report focuses on hunger, not disease outbreaks. Eliminating the plague would help population health but might not directly resolve famine caused by agricultural failure or war.\n\nB) The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century  \n- The agricultural revolution included innovations like crop rotation and improved farming techniques, which reduced the need for fallow fields and increased food production. By increasing food yields, this would directly address hunger issues described in the report.\n\nC) The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work  \n- The putting-out system was a proto-industrialization method where work was subcontracted to rural workers. While it helped economic activity, it doesn't directly solve food scarcity or famine.\n\nD) A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized  \n- Population decline can sometimes reduce food demand, but the 17th century was marked by population growth overall, and urbanization often increased poverty and hunger.

{"subject": "high_school_european_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nThe passage may be used as evidence that Copernicus differed from the traditional, Aristotelian natural philosophers of his day because he suggested that", "choices": ["the cosmos is spherical", "the Earth is spherical", "the cosmos is geostatic", "the Earth is not stationary"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "the cosmos is spherical", "B": "the Earth is spherical", "C": "the cosmos is geostatic", "D": "the Earth is not stationary", "answer": "The passage from Copernicus discusses several points: that the cosmos is spherical, that the Earth is spherical, and that the Earth is traditionally considered stationary at the center of the universe.

He criticizes the \"military despotism of Bonaparte\" for disrupting traditional laws and customs. He emphasizes the role of monarchs as just and strong rulers who maintain order and suppress revolutionary ideas. He calls for unity among monarchs to save society, maintaining religious principles, and suppressing secret societies, which he calls \"gangrene of society.\"\n\nNow let's assess each choice in relation to Metternich's policies and the results of the Congress of Vienna:\n\nA) \"Metternich's statement about the military despotism of Bonaparte led to the elimination of all empires in Europe.\"\n- This is incorrect. The Congress of Vienna restored many monarchies and empires (like Austria, Russia, Prussia), rather than eliminating empires. Metternich himself was an Austrian statesman upholding the empire.\n\nB) \"Metternich's statement about fulfilling duties indicated his support for the Holy Alliance that controlled the fate of Europe.\"\n- The Holy Alliance was indeed a coalition of monarchs (Russia, Austria, Prussia) aimed at preserving monarchial order and suppressing revolution. Metternich supported it. This option is plausible.\n\nC) \"Metternich's statement about the unity of monarchs alludes to the creation of the Concert of Europe.\"\n- The Concert of Europe was a system of periodic meetings and cooperation among European powers to maintain the balance of power and suppress revolution, established after the Congress of Vienna. The call for unity among monarchs fits well with this.\n\nD) \"Metternich's disgust for secret societies led to the creation of the Carlsbad Decrees.\"\n- The Carlsbad Decrees (1819) were indeed issued under Metternich's influence to suppress liberal and nationalist secret societies and student movements within the German Confederation. This is very directly related to the passage about secret societies being a \"gangrene of society.\"\n\nComparing B, C, and D:\n\n- B references the Holy Alliance, which is about monarchs fulfilling their duties and the alliance to uphold Christian monarchies.\n- C references the Concert of Europe, which is about the cooperation and unity of monarchs.\n- D references the Carlsbad Decrees, which is a direct consequence of Metternich's opposition to secret societies.\n\nSince the question asks: \"The final result of the negotiations led by Metternich during the Congress of Vienna is being referenced in the document above in which of the following ways?\" \n\nThe Congress of Vienna led to the Concert of Europe (C), which was the system of collective security and cooperation. The Holy Alliance (B) was a separate agreement made soon after the Congress but also related. The Carlsbad Decrees (D) were issued in 1819, before the Congress of Vienna but are related to Metternich's policies.\n\nSince the excerpt mentions the unity among monarchs as the basis of policy to save society, and this unity is a hallmark of the Concert of Europe system, the best answer is C.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom.

And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry.

The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that", "choices": ["society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it", "a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature", "the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property", "only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness"], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it", "B": "a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature", "C": "the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property", "D": "only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness", "answer": "First, let's analyze the passage and the question. Pangloss represents the philosophy of optimism, specifically Leibnizian optimism, which argues that \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.\" This is a philosophical stance, not directly about government or economics. However, Candide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" reflects this optimistic worldview.\n\nNow, the question asks which Enlightenment belief this statement reflects. Let's examine each choice:\n\nA) \"Society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it.\"  \nThis relates to Enlightenment faith in reason and progress through science and rationality, which aligns with the belief in perfectibility and progress.\n\nB) \"A people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature.\"  \nThis is more a Hobbesian view, emphasizing the need for authority to prevent chaos.\n\nC) \"The only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property.\"  \nThis is Locke's social contract theory, focusing on government's role.\n\nD) \"Only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness.\"  \nThis is an economic belief more aligned with Adam Smith and classical economics.\n\nGiven the passage and the optimistic philosophy expressed, the best match is A, which reflects the Enlightenment belief in progress and perfectibility of society through reason and the scientific method.\n\nAnswer: A"}
{"subject": "high_school_european_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Courtier ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . .\nI would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those weapons that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . .\nOur Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .\nI would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein.

The courtier is expected to be skilled in arms (military training), physically fit, knowledgeable in humanities (Latin, Greek, poetry, history, rhetoric), musically talented, and well-rounded in many disciplines. This reflects the Renaissance ideal of a well-educated, versatile aristocrat, especially a young nobleman preparing for court life.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA) Coeducational public high schools paid for by the state – Castiglione's ideal courtier is a man, and there is no indication that he supports education for women in this context. Public schooling and coeducation are modern ideas that would not fit his Renaissance aristocratic ideal.\nB) Male-only public high schools paid for by the state – The emphasis on public education is modern and unlikely, as education for nobles was typically private or through tutors, not state-sponsored schools.\nC) Public universities without tuition for all students of both genders – Again, coeducation and public free universities are modern concepts and do not align with the Renaissance aristocratic and elite education model.\nD) Private high schools for elite young men with many extracurricular activities – This aligns best with Castiglione's description. The courtier is an elite young man who should be trained in arms, humanities, music, and physical fitness, which corresponds to a private school environment with various extracurricular activities.\n\nTherefore, the reform Castiglione would most likely want is the creation of private schools for elite young men that provide comprehensive training in physical, intellectual, and artistic pursuits.\n\nAnswer: D"}

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the natives in which of the following ways?", "choices": ["Economic opportunities were reduced.", "They were subjugated and destroyed.", "Economic opportunities were created.", "They were enriched through trade in agricultural goods."], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "Economic opportunities were reduced.", "B": "They were subjugated and destroyed.", "C": "Economic opportunities were created.", "D": "They were enriched through trade in agricultural goods.", "answer": "First, let's analyze the information and the question carefully.\n\nThe question asks about the effects of the Columbian Exchange on the natives, based on the excerpts provided.\n\n- Source 1 (Columbus) describes natives bartering goods for European items and Columbus giving them gifts to gain their goodwill and to encourage them to become Christians and to help collect goods.\n- Source 2 (de las Casas) describes the brutal treatment and destruction of natives by the Spanish, with a drastic population decline due to violence and exploitation motivated by greed for gold.\n\nThe Columbian Exchange involved the transfer of plants, animals, and goods between the Old and New Worlds.

{"subject": "high_school_european_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nWhat was the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few\"?", "choices": ["The populous demanded rights from the state.", "People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.", "Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.", "European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity."], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "The populous demanded rights from the state.", "B": "People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.", "C": "Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.", "D": "European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.", "answer": "Let's analyze the passage and the question carefully:\n\nThe passage discusses Erasmus's work \"Adagiorum Collectanea,\" which made classical Latin literature and ideas more accessible beyond the small group of elite humanists. Before Erasmus, humanism was \"the exclusive privilege of a few,\" used to demonstrate learning and elegance to others who didn't have access to it. Erasmus, by making classical knowledge more available, helped spread the \"classic spirit\" to a wider audience, though still limited to the educated upper classes.\n\nThe key phrase is: \"Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few.\" The question asks about the primary impact of this change.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA) The populous demanded rights from the state.\n- The passage doesn't mention political movements or demands for rights by the general population. Also, humanism was still largely limited to the educated upper classes, not the entire populace. This is unlikely.\n\nB) People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\n- The passage mentions Erasmus's love for teaching and spreading classical knowledge to a wider educated audience. Since the Church was a dominant authority at the time, and Erasmus was part of the early Reformation era, spreading classical learning (and critical thought) could indeed encourage questioning established religious doctrines. This seems plausible.\n\nC) Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.\n- The passage states that Erasmus wrote in Latin and influenced educated classes, but it does not say Latin replaced vernacular languages. In fact, by the 16th century, vernacular languages were becoming more prominent in literature. So this is unlikely.\n\nD) European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.\n- The passage portrays the spread of classical knowledge positively, as enlightening and broadening culture. There is no mention of stagnation or decline in literature. So this is unlikely.\n\nBetween these, B is the best supported answer.\n\nAnswer: B"}
