Severe atopic dermatitis is a common allergic manifestation on the skin. Enterocolitis, which is inflammation of the small intestine and colon, can also occur as a gastrointestinal symptom due to allergic reactions. Diarrhoea is another common symptom linked to food allergies or intolerances because of the gut's response to an allergen. Since all these symptoms can be associated with cow's milk allergy/intolerance, the most comprehensive answer is that all of the above symptoms can be displayed.\n\nAnswer: D"}

When alcohol is consumed, it is primarily metabolized in the liver.\n2. The main pathway involves alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converting ethanol to acetaldehyde.\n3. Acetaldehyde is then rapidly converted to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).\n4. Acetate can be further metabolized to acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle.\n\nThus, the main metabolites directly formed during alcohol metabolism are acetaldehyde and acetate.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) Acetaldehyde, acetate — these are indeed the main metabolites of alcohol metabolism.\nB) Pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate — these are related to carbohydrate and fat metabolism, not directly involved in alcohol metabolism.\nC) Acetyl-CoA, lipids — acetyl-CoA is a downstream product, and lipids are not primary metabolites in alcohol metabolism.\nD) Acetone, lactate — acetone is a ketone body, lactate is a product of anaerobic glycolysis, unrelated to primary alcohol metabolism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nAnswer: A"}

Extensive research has shown that approved GM foods are safe to eat and do not cause cancer or other health problems. Therefore, this option is not accurate.\n\nB) Yes, because they can provide us with a more abundant and economical food supply for the world as well as continued improvement in nutritional quality  \nThis option highlights the main benefits of GM foods: increasing food production, potentially lowering costs, and improving nutritional content. These factors directly contribute to food security and can help adapt agriculture to climate change challenges. This is a strong and valid argument.\n\nC) Yes, because they are cheaper than non-GM foods  \nWhile GM foods can sometimes be cheaper to produce due to higher yield or pest resistance, the cost advantage varies by region and crop.

Therefore, the headspace oxygen in canned foods is usually minimized, not kept high, to preserve vitamin C. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB) Reheating canned vegetables before serving only causes small losses of vitamin C  \n- Vitamin C is heat-sensitive, and reheating can cause significant losses, especially if the heating is prolonged or intense. However, if reheating is brief or gentle, losses might be small. This statement could be correct depending on the context, but generally reheating can cause notable losses.\n\nC) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables  \n- Vitamin C content and stability vary between fruits and vegetables, but generally, canned vegetables tend to lose more vitamin C than canned fruits due to processing methods and initial vitamin C content. Thus, this statement is likely incorrect.\n\nD) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small  \n- Vitamin C degrades over time during storage, especially at ambient temperature, but in canned foods, the degradation rate can be relatively slow due to lack of oxygen and sealed environment.

Type 2 diabetes is often characterized by insulin resistance, and some patients may require high doses of insulin or other medications. Also, the severity of diabetes is not simply \"milder\" in type 2; it's a different pathophysiology. This statement is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.\n\nB) Persons with type 1 diabetes rapidly develop chronic complications.\n- Chronic complications of diabetes usually develop over years and are related to poor glycemic control. While type 1 diabetes can lead to complications, they don't necessarily develop rapidly. This is not the best description.\n\nC) Autoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes.\n- This is accurate. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells.

Males can develop anorexia, though less commonly than females, and it can affect individuals from any socioeconomic status.\n\nD) Prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents  \n- This is an overestimate. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in female adolescents is generally reported to be less than 1%, often around 0.3-0.5%.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct statement about the epidemiology of Anorexia Nervosa is:\n\nAnswer: C"}

The oral phase involves mechanical digestion (chewing) and the initiation of swallowing, which consumes some energy but is generally a small percentage of the total energy content of food. So this is likely correct.\n\nB) Swallowing involves contraction and relaxation of at least 14 groups of muscles in about 10 seconds in healthy subjects.  \n- Swallowing is a complex process involving many muscles. The number 14 muscle groups and a duration of about 10 seconds is consistent with physiological knowledge. So this is also correct.\n\nC) The biofilm covering tooth enamel contains several salivary and bacterial enzymes.  \n- Dental biofilm (plaque) is known to contain bacterial enzymes. Saliva also contains enzymes, and the biofilm is bathed in saliva, so the presence of salivary enzymes in the biofilm is plausible. This statement is likely correct.\n\nD) Salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose.  \n- Salivary amylase digests starch (polysaccharides like amylose and amylopectin) into maltose and dextrins. However, the dextran film on tooth enamel is a glucan produced by bacterial action on sucrose, which is not digested by salivary amylase. Instead, dextran is a product of bacterial glucosyltransferase enzymes, not digested by amylase. Therefore, salivary amylase does not digest the dextran film on tooth enamel.\n\nThus, the incorrect statement is D.\n\nAnswer: D"}

So, this is only partially correct.\n\nC) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive:  \nThis is accurate. Some amino acid catabolic pathways are irreversible and represent true metabolic demand. Obligatory demand comes from processes that always consume amino acids irreversibly (e.g., synthesis of certain compounds), while adaptive demand varies with physiological conditions.\n\nD) The metabolic demand is a fixed amount:  \nThis is incorrect because metabolic demand varies with age, physiological state, disease, and other factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is C.\n\nAnswer: C"}

This is important because it tells us how much of the food containing the substance people typically eat.\n- Option B refers to the concentration of the substance in food. This is also relevant, as it indicates how much of the substance is present per unit of food.\n- Option C refers to the daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food. This combines both the concentration in the food and the amount of food consumed, giving a more precise measure of exposure.\n- Option D is about the total amount consumed over a lifetime, which is important for chronic exposure but is less directly used in the initial safety evaluation compared to daily intake.\n\nConsidering this, toxicity data from animals combined with human daily intake data (which reflects real exposure levels) are used to evaluate safety.

Malic and succinic acids are intermediate compounds in metabolism but are not the main fermentation end products. Thus, this statement is somewhat incorrect or at least incomplete.\n\nB) Fermentation studies in vitro, with human feces, have shown that soluble and insoluble forms are fermented completely within 24 hours.\n- Insoluble fibers like cellulose are not fermented completely within 24 hours; they are fermented slowly or not at all. Soluble fibers are more readily fermented. So, this statement overgeneralizes and is inaccurate.\n\nC) Fibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins and inulin are rapidly fermented to short chain fatty acids, which have trophic effects on the colon.\n- This statement is accurate. Hemicelluloses, pectins, and inulin are soluble fibers that are rapidly fermented by colonic bacteria into SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate). These SCFAs have trophic (growth-promoting) effects on the colonic mucosa.\n\nD) Stool bulking occurs mainly through the action of insoluble fibres such as cellulose.\n- This is also true. Insoluble fibers like cellulose increase stool bulk by adding mass and water, leading to increased fecal bulk and decreased transit time.\n\nBetween C and D, both are correct statements, but the question asks which is \"most correct\" about dietary fiber.

Insulin can have systemic effects, but the primary stimulator of small intestinal motility is not typically insulin. Rather, nutrients in the small intestine stimulate motility via hormones like motilin and neural reflexes. This statement links starch's effect on motility directly to insulin release, which is not commonly described as the mechanism for increasing intestinal motility. This might be false.\n\nB) Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion.\n\n- This is well-established physiology. Gastrin is released by G cells in the stomach in response to food and stimulates acid secretion. This is true.\n\nC) Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility.\n\n- Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced in the colon by fermentation and can influence motility. Reflux from colon to caecum is not typical, but if such reflux occurs, SCFAs could stimulate motility. This statement seems plausible.\n\nD) The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern.\n\n- Lipid in the duodenum triggers release of hormones like CCK, which slows gastric emptying and intestinal motility initially (intestinal brake). The switch from fasting (migrating motor complex) to feeding pattern occurs with nutrient presence. This is true.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is most likely A.\n\nAnswer: A"}

If insulin is deficient, lipolysis actually increases, not decreases.\n\nB) Increased ketogenesis: Because of increased lipolysis, free fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies in the liver, so ketogenesis increases.\n\nC) Reduced gluconeogenesis: Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis (production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources). In insulin deficiency, gluconeogenesis is increased, not reduced.\n\nD) Reduced proteolysis: Insulin inhibits proteolysis (breakdown of proteins). In insulin deficiency, proteolysis increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct association is increased ketogenesis.\n\nAnswer: B"}
{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Which hormone is thought to mediate this effect?\n", "choices": ["Testosterone", "Oestrogen", "Insulin-like growth factor-1", "Thyroxine"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "Testosterone", "B": "Oestrogen", "C": "Insulin-like growth factor-1", "D": "Thyroxine", "answer": "Reasoning:\nObesity is associated with increased levels of certain hormones, which can influence the risk of developing various cancers. Specifically for endometrial cancer, the key hormone linked to increased risk due to obesity is estrogen (oestrogen). This is because adipose tissue (fat) can convert androgens to estrogens via the enzyme aromatase, leading to higher circulating estrogen levels in obese individuals. Elevated estrogen stimulates the endometrial lining, increasing the risk of hyperplasia and cancer. \n\nTestosterone is more related to male hormones, insulin-like growth factor-1 is involved in growth and could be linked to some cancers but not primarily endometrial cancer risk in obesity, and thyroxine is a thyroid hormone, unrelated to this mechanism.\n\nAnswer: B"}

Decades of underinvestment in agriculture and rural infrastructure reduced productivity and supply resilience, contributing to price volatility.\n\nB) The use of food crops to produce biofuel caused food prices to rise.\n- This is also true. Increased diversion of food crops like corn to biofuel production reduced the supply of food grains, pushing prices higher.\n\nC) It was caused by commodity price speculation.\n- This is true as well.

It generally decreases glycolysis to increase blood glucose. So this statement is incorrect.\n\nB) Glycolysis requires NADP+  \nGlycolysis uses NAD+, not NADP+, as a coenzyme in the oxidation step. NADP+ is mainly involved in anabolic pathways like the pentose phosphate pathway. So this statement is incorrect.\n\nC) In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products  \nYes, glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is split into two three-carbon molecules (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) during glycolysis. This statement is correct.\n\nD) The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate  \nIn red blood cells, which lack mitochondria, pyruvate is quickly converted to lactate to regenerate NAD+ for glycolysis. So the main end-product here is lactate, not pyruvate. So this statement is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Isoflavonoids, including isoflavones, are often considered a subclass of flavonoids. So this statement seems correct.\n\nB) The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing.\n- Processing often affects the bioavailability and digestibility of bioactive compounds. For isoflavones in soy, processing such as fermentation or heat treatment can alter their form and bioavailability. Thus, this statement is likely incorrect.\n\nC) ß-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A.\n- ß-Carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid because it can be converted into vitamin A. Lycopene, however, does not have provitamin A activity. So this statement is incorrect.\n\nD) Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\n- Flavonoids are polyphenols, but carotenoids are not polyphenols; they are pigments derived from isoprenoid pathways.

However, adaptation to different protein intakes can take time (days to weeks), and not all studies fully account for this adaptation period. Therefore, adaptation is often not fully accounted for in study design.\n\nB) The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization  \n- Adaptation can change how efficiently protein is used; if adaptation is incomplete or variable, the slope (which represents efficiency) may be underestimated because the body hasn't adjusted fully to the protein intake. This seems plausible.\n\nC) Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD  \n- EAR (Estimated Average Requirement) plus 2 standard deviations is used to set the RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance), accounting for variability among individuals but not necessarily fully accounting for variable adaptation between studies. Adaptation variability might not be completely captured in this statistical approach.\n\nD) Adaptation should not influence the interpretation of N-balance studies.  \n- This is incorrect because adaptation significantly affects nitrogen balance results, and ignoring it would lead to misinterpretation.\n\nConsidering these points, option B stands out as the correct statement.\n\nAnswer: B"}
