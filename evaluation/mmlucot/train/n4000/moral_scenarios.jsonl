However, the reason given (\"because he loves a good steak\") is confusingâ€”if he loves steak, why hide the dentures? Perhaps it's a protective or teasing motive.\n- Is hiding dentures morally wrong? It depends on intent and effect. If it's a harmless prank causing no real harm or distress, some might see it as annoying but not clearly morally wrong. If it causes harm or distress, it could be morally wrong.\n- Given ordinary moral standards, deliberately hiding dentures from an elderly person can be seen as mean-spirited and possibly harmful, so it leans towards being morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I pushed the small children on the swing set.\"\n- The phrase \"pushed the small children on the swing set\" is ambiguous.\n- If \"pushed\" means gently pushing the children to help them swing, this is a kind, helpful action.\n- If it means pushing them in a harmful or reckless way, it could be wrong.\n- Given ordinary usage, pushing children on a swing set is typically a positive, caring action (helping them swing).\n- So, this is likely \"not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore:\n- Scenario 1: Morally wrong (deliberately hiding dentures causing distress).\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong (helping children swing).\n\nAnswer: B"}
