The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance.

Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation.

Beveridge argues in favor of governing peoples without their consent, justifying it by saying that some people are not capable of self-government and that it is a duty to civilize and govern them. He specifically mentions the Philippines and the idea of rescuing them from \"savage\" rule, implying an imperialist rationale for American expansion and control over other territories. The emphasis on duty to the world, the civilizing mission, and control over new territories aligns with the ideology of imperialism.\n\n- Imperialism is the policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization or military force.\n- Anti-imperialism opposes such expansion and domination.\n- Isolationism is a policy of avoiding involvement in foreign affairs.\n- Manifest Destiny refers to the 19th-century belief that the U.S. was destined to expand across the North American continent, but this speech focuses on overseas territories like the Philippines, which is more about imperialism.\n\nTherefore, Beveridge’s sentiment best fits imperialism.\n\nAnswer: A"}

It is well to notice this advantage—the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage.

Frederick Douglass in 1857 states that slaveholders have a \"decided advantage\" because they are completely organized, with the state governments, church organizations, and even the Federal Government supporting slavery. The \"pen, the purse, and the sword\" are united against the truth, implying that the Federal Government is complicit in maintaining slavery.\n\n2. The question asks how Abraham Lincoln's actions in 1860 contradicted Douglass's claim that the Federal Government was fully pledged to support slavery.\n\nNow, let's review the answer choices:\n\nA) Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\n\n- This refers to popular sovereignty, a policy more associated with Stephen Douglas. Lincoln opposed popular sovereignty in terms of allowing slavery; he wanted to prevent the spread of slavery. So this is not an action of Lincoln that contradicts Douglass.\n\nB) Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\n\n- The Homestead Act was passed in 1862, after Lincoln's election, and while it helped settlers, it was not directly related to slavery or contradicting the government's support of slavery.\n\nC) Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\n\n- This aligns with Lincoln's platform in 1860: he opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories. This position contradicts Douglass's claim that the Federal Government is pledged to support slavery; Lincoln, as the President-elect, was working to restrict slavery's spread.\n\nD) Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\"\n\n- This policy was never enacted by Lincoln; it is associated with post-Civil War Reconstruction efforts and General Sherman's Special Field Orders No. 15. Thus, this is incorrect.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLincoln's opposition to the expansion of slavery into new territories (C) contradicted Douglass's claim that the federal government was fully committed to supporting slavery.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.

This is opposite to the Populist desire to empower the common people.\n\nD) Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s: This movement emphasized expanded suffrage and greater democracy for the \"common man,\" and opposed elites and corruption.

It mentions that the Republican Party aims to wage war against slavery, exclude the South from common territory, and alter the judicial system in a sectional manner. This reflects the political climate surrounding Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860. Lincoln and the Republican Party opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories, which alarmed Southern states that depended on slavery. South Carolina's declaration states that the Union is dissolved due to these perceived threats.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\nA) The Compromise of 1850 did not directly lead to secession in 1860; it was more of an earlier attempt to ease sectional tensions.\nB) The Battle of Fort Sumter occurred in April 1861, after secession had already happened; it did not cause secession.\nC) The Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, after the Civil War had begun; thus it did not cause secession.\nD) Lincoln's election on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery (Free-Soil platform) is the key event that led Southern politicians to secede, as they felt their rights and way of life were threatened.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is choice D.\n\nAnswer: D"}

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.'

Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament.

His key concern is the denial of American self-government and the imposition of British control. He describes the failed attempts to seek peace and reconciliation with the British crown and argues that the colonies must fight for their freedom. The phrase \"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\" emphasizes the desire for liberty and self-rule.\n\nNow let's consider the answer choices:\nA) No entangling alliances with foreign countries - This is a principle often associated with George Washington's farewell address, not Henry's speech.\nB) The dangers of standing armies - While Henry and others did express concerns about standing armies, this passage focuses more on liberty and resistance to tyranny.\nC) Self-government - The passage clearly reflects the concern about being governed by the British Parliament and ministry, and the desire for liberty and self-rule.\nD) The separation of church and state - This issue is not addressed in this passage.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C) Self-government.\n\nAnswer: C"}

She criticizes the administration for rigging the rules against many people, mentions the fear of nuclear warheads, and focuses on social and economic fairness.\n\nLet's analyze each choice:\n\nA) Opposition to the administration's arms buildup\n- Ferraro mentions \"young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads,\" which reflects concern about nuclear arms buildup. This indicates she is critical of the arms buildup, so her ideas would strengthen opposition to it.\n\nB) Efforts to deregulate many industries\n- Deregulation was a hallmark of the Reagan administration, which Ferraro is criticizing. Her emphasis on fairness and rules that work for all Americans suggests she would not support deregulation efforts that benefited corporations at the expense of individuals.\n\nC) Efforts to reform the welfare system\n- While she talks about fairness and helping working Americans, there is no direct mention of welfare reform efforts in this passage, so this is less directly connected.\n\nD) Support for the administration's cold war policies\n- She is critical of the current administration's policies, including the arms buildup, indicating she does not support the administration's Cold War policies.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A) Opposition to the administration's arms buildup.\n\nAnswer: A"}

The question is: on what grounds?\n\nLet's examine the answer options:\n\nA) violated the Constitutional injunction against bills of attainder.\n- Bills of attainder are legislative acts that punish a specific person or group without trial. This law is general and criminalizes certain conduct. It doesn't seem focused on punishing a particular person or group without trial, so this is unlikely.\n\nB) undermined the intent of the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution.\n- The Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2) requires that escaped slaves be returned to their owners. States in the North passed laws that resisted or undermined this clause by protecting free Blacks or interfering with slave owners' rights. Pennsylvania's law punishes those who forcibly carry away Black people to be sold as slaves. This could interfere with slaveholders' ability to reclaim or move slaves. So critics might claim this law undermines the federal fugitive slave clause.\n\nC) circumvented the three-fifths clause of the Constitution.\n- The three-fifths clause is about counting slaves for representation and taxation, not about the movement or treatment of slaves. This law does not address representation or taxation, so unlikely.\n\nD) was inconsistent with the \"eminent domain\" clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\n- Eminent domain is about the government's power to take private property for public use with just compensation. This law punishes kidnapping or fraud in moving people but does not relate to eminent domain.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}

At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands.

{"subject": "high_school_us_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"I know that whenever the subject has occurred in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared to be the opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented. But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n—Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the", "choices": ["Homestead Act of 1862.", "Immigration Act of 1921.", "Supreme Court decision in Plessy v.

It changed policies regarding communal land ownership and governance, which was a shift from previous policies under President Andrew Jackson, who had enacted the Indian Removal Act leading to forced relocation.\n\nConsidering the question mentions President Jackson's policy, and among these choices, the Dawes Act is the one that altered Native American policy initiated by Jackson.

{"subject": "high_school_us_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n—John C.
