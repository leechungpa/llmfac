This was a product of efforts led by Simón Bolívar to unite newly independent Latin American territories.\n\nSource 2 is the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil (1824), which establishes Brazil as a constitutional hereditary monarchy under Dom Pedro I, following independence from Portugal.\n\nBoth documents are constitutions created shortly after independence movements in Latin America. They reflect the new political order established by local leaders and elites after overthrowing colonial rule.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA) Nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism - This is relevant to Gran Colombia, which was an attempt to unite multiple countries in northern South America. This is a strong candidate because Gran Colombia was an embodiment of pan-Americanism. However, the Brazilian constitution establishes a monarchy, which is not an expression of pan-Americanism but rather a conservative constitutional monarchy. So while Gran Colombia fits this, Brazil is different.\n\nB) Revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations - This is also very plausible. The independence movements were often led by local or provincial elites who revolted against colonial rule and then established new constitutions. Both Gran Colombia and Brazil's constitutions reflect the political will of local elites after independence.\n\nC) Aboriginal natives gathering the support of provincials to create constitutions - This is unlikely historically since indigenous groups did not lead the constitutional creation processes in these countries. Most independence movements were elite-led.\n\nD) Colonial powers preparing their colonies for independence - This is unlikely because independence was won through revolts and wars against colonial powers, not through colonial powers preparing them to be independent.\n\nBetween A and B, B is more broadly applicable to both situations.

Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens.

He also notes that his farm was damaged by a contingent of 1,500 natives encamped nearby. Importantly, he is suing the British government for damages caused by these natives.\n\nThe question asks about the purpose of mentioning the pending litigation against the British government.\n\n- Option A: Highlight the extent of the author's property losses.\n  - The author does describe his losses in detail, but the mention of suing the government specifically points to more than just highlighting losses; it indicates he holds the government responsible.\n\n- Option B: Express his opposition to the ongoing war.\n  - There is no clear expression of opposition to the war itself. He does not criticize the war, but rather the damage caused.\n\n- Option C: Belittle British officials.\n  - There is no mocking or belittling tone toward British officials apparent in the excerpt.\n\n- Option D: Place blame on both his home country as well as the Zulus.\n  - He blames the \"Queen's enemies\" (Zulus) for destruction, but also blames the British government for the damage caused by natives encamped nearby, implying the government failed to protect his property or allowed this situation. This suggests assigning blame to both sides.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion of the litigation mention serves to place blame on both the Zulus (the Queen's enemies) and the British government for his damages.\n\nAnswer: D"}

Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSimón de Bolívar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system?", "choices": ["Truth and religion", "Freedom and democracy", "Intelligence and order", "Morality and justice"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "Truth and religion", "B": "Freedom and democracy", "C": "Intelligence and order", "D": "Morality and justice", "answer": "Reasoning:\nIn the passage, Simón de Bolívar discusses the challenges faced by a people who lack political, economic, and civic knowledge, leading to their degradation and loss of freedom.

The Mongol administration in Russia was less about direct governance and more about controlling through tribute and local princes.\n\nOption A: The Mongols were tolerant of multiple religions in China, and in Russia, though Orthodox Christianity was the major religion, the Mongols did not necessarily limit themselves to only Orthodox Christianity, so this is partly true but not the best contrast.\n\nOption B: This option states that Mongol administration in Russia relied heavily on tribute from Russian principalities, while in China the administration emulated a centralized bureaucratic state.

Many African societies had their own cultural norms before Islam arrived, and local customs often blended with Islamic practices, which could explain the lack of veiling as a cultural tradition rather than religious defiance.\n\nC) The idea that women were prevented from veiling because they were sexual objects does not fit the passage's description.

Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von Füch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nWhich of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?", "choices": ["The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan", "The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers", "The general warming of the climate during this time period", "The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan", "B": "The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers", "C": "The general warming of the climate during this time period", "D": "The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites", "answer": "First, let's analyze the second passage about the Yakut and Tungus natives in Siberia. The passage mentions the forced payment of yasak tribute, which was in furs (sables, foxes) or cash. It notes that furbearing animals became scarce, partly because of overhunting, and that many natives lost their horses, which made hunting difficult.\n\nThe question asks for a factor NOT mentioned in the second passage that would have made it even harder for these natives to meet their tribute obligations.\n\nLet's consider each choice:\n\nA) Arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan: The passage does not mention competition from other hunters, but if rival hunters arrived, they would reduce fur availability further, making it harder for natives to hunt enough furs. This would add difficulty.\n\nB) Impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers: The passage does not mention disease, but epidemics introduced by settlers historically devastated indigenous populations, reducing their ability to hunt and provide tribute. This would also add difficulty.\n\nC) General warming of the climate during this time period: The passage does not mention climate changes. A warming climate could affect the habitat of fur-bearing animals, possibly reducing their populations or shifting them geographically, making hunting harder. This could add difficulty.\n\nD) Reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites: The passage notes scarcity of animals, but not demand changes. If demand for furs dropped, the obligation to pay tribute in furs might decrease or become less burdensome, or natives might find it harder to trade furs for cash. However, reduced demand would likely lessen the pressure, not add difficulty.\n\nSince the question asks for a factor NOT mentioned in the passage that would have made things harder, and D likely reduces difficulty, it's not the best choice.\n\nBetween A, B, and C, all could add difficulties, but A (rival hunters) and B (epidemics) are plausible historical factors that would directly reduce native hunting capability.\n\nHowever, epidemics are a well-documented cause of indigenous population decline following contact with Europeans, and would have a severe impact.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}

Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

The English generally did not view natives as equals; relations varied, but equality was not a general English policy.\n\nB) \"were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership\" — This is true historically. English colonists often misunderstood native concepts of land use and ownership, leading to conflicts over land. English colonists believed in private land ownership, whereas many natives had communal or different concepts of land use.\n\nC) \"widely did not condone intermingling with the natives\" — This is also accurate. English settlers generally discouraged or prohibited intermarriage or intermingling, unlike the Spanish, who often intermarried and created a mixed mestizo population.\n\nD) \"used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton\" — This is not accurate. While the English did establish cash crop economies, they did not use natives exclusively as laborers; in many cases, they used African slave labor or indentured servants.\n\nBetween B and C, both are true, but the question asks how English treatment differed from the Spanish practices in the excerpt.\n\nThe Spanish excerpt speaks about brutal exploitation, forced labor, and concubinage. The English treatment differed in that they generally did not condone intermingling (C). The English also had misunderstandings about land ownership (B), but that is not a direct comparison to the Spanish practices described here.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "B": "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "C": "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "D": "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government", "answer": "Let's analyze the context and content of the excerpts and question:\n\n- The passages discuss the Indian Rebellion (or Mutiny) of 1857, specifically focusing on the violence during the Cawnpore massacres.\n- The first passage describes the rebellion as a war of religion, race, and revenge, led by native Indians against British rulers.\n- The second passage highlights that the rebellion shattered the British monopoly on violence but emphasizes the racial and hierarchical superiority the British claimed.\n- Historically, the rebellion of 1857 was ultimately suppressed by the British.\n- As a consequence of the rebellion, the British East India Company's rule was ended.\n- The British Crown took direct control of India, initiating the period known as the British Raj.\n- This marked the beginning of direct British government rule rather than company rule.\n- Indian rebels were defeated in the short term; independence was not achieved until much later (1947).\n\nNow, evaluate the options:\n\nA) The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India  \n- Partially correct: The East India Company was expelled, but partial home rule did not come immediately after 1857.\n\nB) British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company  \n- Incorrect: The British East India Company lost power and was dissolved after the rebellion.\n\nC) Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority  \n- Incorrect: The rebellion was suppressed, and independence was not gained.\n\nD) The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government  \n- Correct: Indian rebels were defeated, and the British government took direct control over India.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nAnswer: D"}

The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is intended to do which of the following?", "choices": ["Demonstrate the possibility of African unity", "Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers", "Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations", "Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "Demonstrate the possibility of African unity", "B": "Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers", "C": "Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations", "D": "Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa", "answer": "First, let's analyze the passage and Nkrumah's main points:\n\n- Nkrumah emphasizes that African unity is crucial for peace and respect on the world stage.\n- He mentions the lack of attention paid to African opposition to French atomic tests and the U.N.'s ineffective intervention in the Congo.\n- He uses these examples to illustrate the \"callous disregard\" of African independence by Great Powers.\n\nSpecifically, the mention of the Congo shows how the U.N. (representing international powers) is more concerned with procedural issues (\"constitutional niceties\") rather than the real crisis (\"the Republic was tottering into anarchy\"). This supports the argument that African nations are neglected or ignored by powerful countries.\n\nNow, let's examine each choice:\n\nA) Demonstrate the possibility of African unity - The paragraph does not use the Congo as a positive example of unity; instead, it shows chaos and neglect.\n\nB) Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers - This fits perfectly with the message that the Congo situation exemplifies the disregard shown by Great Powers.\n\nC) Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations - The passage actually says the U.N. focuses on constitutional issues while the country is falling into disorder, so this is not supported.\n\nD) Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa - Although Nkrumah is critical, the emphasis is on neglect by Great Powers broadly, and the example focuses on the U.N. and French tests. This choice is partly correct but less precise than B.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}

Portugal was granted control of lands east of this line, while Spain got lands to the west. \n\nHistorically, Portugal's interest in the eastern route was based on their knowledge and exploration of a sea route to India by sailing around the southern tip of Africa (the Cape of Good Hope). This route was crucial for Portugal’s trade ambitions, especially for spices and other valuable goods from Asia.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the New World was west of the demarcation line, and the Portuguese route to the New World was not by traveling east.\n- Option B is not relevant to this treaty; the crusades were not the immediate concern.\n- Option C is incorrect because Mexico was part of the lands west of the line, which Spain controlled.\n- Option D correctly identifies Portugal’s strategic interest in the Indian Ocean trade route via the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nAnswer: D"}

{"subject": "high_school_world_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's efforts to advance Russia as justified by his mention of the \"continual beatings\" were vindicated by which of the following historical events?", "choices": ["The Space Race with the United States", "The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s", "The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War", "The German invasion of Russia in 1941"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "The Space Race with the United States", "B": "The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s", "C": "The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War", "D": "The German invasion of Russia in 1941", "answer": "Reasoning:\nIn the speech, Stalin talks about Russia's historical backwardness and the \"continual beatings\" suffered by Russia from various foreign powers. He emphasizes the need to advance and modernize to avoid further exploitation and defeat. The question asks which historical event vindicated Stalin's efforts to advance Russia.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA) The Space Race with the United States: The Space Race took place during the Cold War, mainly in the 1950s and 1960s, after Stalin's death in 1953. It demonstrated Soviet technological and scientific advancement, which can be seen as a result of earlier industrialization efforts. Although indicative of Soviet strength, it is somewhat removed from Stalin's immediate time and efforts.\n\nB) The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s: This war occurred before Stalin's speech in 1931 and was more about defending the Bolshevik regime. It was not a clear victory that demonstrated the success of industrial or military modernization.\n\nC) The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War: This was during the period 1918-1920, when Western powers intervened to try to defeat the Bolsheviks. This occurred before Stalin's speech and does not reflect the success of his industrialization policies.\n\nD) The German invasion of Russia in 1941: This was during World War II (the Great Patriotic War). Despite the initial setbacks, the USSR managed to withstand and eventually defeat Nazi Germany. The Soviet industrialization and military modernization efforts under Stalin in the 1930s were critical in enabling the Soviet Union to endure and repel the invasion.\n\nTherefore, Stalin's emphasis on overcoming backwardness and strengthening the nation was vindicated by the Soviet Union's ability to resist and defeat the German invasion in 1941, demonstrating the success of his efforts to modernize industry and the military.\n\nAnswer: D"}

The question, however, asks about trade policies under the Ming Dynasty, which followed the Yuan.\n\nThe Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) is known for several key policies regarding trade and merchants:\n\n- It initially lifted some restrictions on trade and sponsored naval expeditions (Zheng He's voyages) to promote trade abroad, but later it adopted a more isolationist policy, restricting foreign trade to specific ports.\n- The government did monopolize certain resources, but the question is about changes in trade policy, so monopolizing salt and iron was a long-standing policy even before Ming.\n- The Ming government did not encourage merchants to conduct trade missions abroad; rather, they were cautious about foreign influence.\n- The Ming government strongly adhered to Confucian principles, which traditionally devalued merchants, and did not abandon these principles to allow merchants greater participation in government.\n\nOption A refers to restricting foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities, which aligns with the Ming later policy of restricting foreign trade to designated ports like Canton.\n\nOption B refers to monopolizing salt and iron, which was not a new change under Ming but a continuation.\n\nOption C is incorrect; the Ming government did not endorse Chinese merchants to conduct trade missions abroad.\n\nOption D is incorrect; the Ming maintained Confucian principles and did not increase merchants' political participation.\n\nFinal answer: A\n\nAnswer: A"}

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

The king himself follows a pagan religion, and the common people are also described as polytheists. The passage also mentions the importance of gold and salt trade and the levies imposed by the king on these goods.\n\nGiven this context, the presence of a Muslim in charge of the treasury is likely related to the practical and economic role Muslims played in facilitating trade, especially since many merchants at the time were Muslim and Islam was widespread across trade networks in West Africa. The king had not converted to Islam himself, and the passage explicitly says the king's religion is paganism, ruling out choice B. There is no indication that trade was taboo in the traditional religion, so C is unlikely. Nor does the passage suggest that African kings were vassals to Muslim caliphs; rather, they appear independent, so D is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is A: having a Muslim official in charge of the treasury would facilitate trade with Muslim merchants.\n\nAnswer: A"}
