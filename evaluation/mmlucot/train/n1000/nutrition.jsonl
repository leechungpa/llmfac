Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density, which increases fracture risk. So this does not increase fracture risk.\n\nB) High body weight - Higher body weight tends to be protective against osteoporosis and fractures because of greater mechanical loading on bones, which helps maintain bone density. So this also does not increase fracture risk.\n\nC) High lean mass - Higher lean mass (muscle mass) usually contributes to better bone health and strength, as muscles exert forces on bones that stimulate bone formation. This is protective against fractures.\n\nD) Poor muscle strength - Poor muscle strength can lead to instability, increased falls, and less mechanical stimulation of bones, all of which increase fracture risk.\n\nTherefore, the correct factor that increases risk of osteoporotic fracture is poor muscle strength.\n\nAnswer: D"}
{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "A blood sample is taken from a 45 year old man after he has broken his overnight fast by eating three slices of toast and a boiled egg. Which one of the following will be at a higher concentration than if the blood sample had been taken before breakfast?\n", "choices": ["Alanine", "Glucose", "Ketone bodies", "Non-esterified (free) fatty acids"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "Alanine", "B": "Glucose", "C": "Ketone bodies", "D": "Non-esterified (free) fatty acids", "answer": "Let's analyze the situation:\n\n- The man has broken his overnight fast by eating three slices of toast and a boiled egg.\n- Before breakfast (i.e., in the fasted state), certain metabolites are at specific levels.\n- After eating, some metabolite levels will change due to digestion and metabolism.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA) Alanine: Alanine is a gluconeogenic amino acid that is released from muscle during fasting to help maintain blood glucose. After eating, especially protein (like an egg), alanine levels may increase slightly due to amino acid absorption, but generally, alanine is not markedly higher postprandially compared to the fasted state.\n\nB) Glucose: After eating carbohydrates (toast), blood glucose will rise due to absorption of glucose from the gut. So, glucose concentration will be higher than the fasting level.\n\nC) Ketone bodies: Ketone bodies are produced during fasting when glucose is scarce. After eating, insulin rises and ketogenesis is suppressed, so ketone body levels fall postprandially.\n\nD) Non-esterified (free) fatty acids: During fasting, free fatty acids are elevated as fat is mobilized for energy. After eating, insulin suppresses lipolysis, so free fatty acid levels decrease postprandially.\n\nTherefore, the metabolite that will be at a higher concentration after eating compared to before breakfast is glucose.\n\nAnswer: B"}

Anorexia Nervosa is much more common in females compared to males, with ratios often cited as around 10:1 (females to males), not just 3:1.\n\nB) It never happens in children or post menopausal women  \n- This is incorrect. Although more common in adolescent and young adult females, anorexia can occur in children and postmenopausal women as well.\n\nC) Males from any socioeconomic background can be affected  \n- This is true. Males can develop anorexia, though less commonly than females, and it can affect individuals from any socioeconomic status.\n\nD) Prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents  \n- This is an overestimate.

High iron stores (iron overload) are less common. Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect.\n\nB) All older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status.\n- While vitamin D deficiency is common among older adults due to less sun exposure and decreased skin synthesis, it is not true that all older people in Western countries have low vitamin D status. This statement is too absolute and therefore incorrect.\n\nC) There is strong evidence that vitamin C supplements lower the risk of cancer in older people.\n- The evidence linking vitamin C supplementation to cancer risk reduction is inconclusive and not strong. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD) Low dietary intake of vitamin B12 is the main cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in older people.\n- In older adults, vitamin B12 deficiency is more commonly caused by malabsorption issues (such as atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia) rather than low dietary intake, since many consume sufficient amounts. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nSince all options seem incorrect at first glance, let's reconsider A more carefully.\n\nA) The risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people.\n- Some studies suggest that older adults may have increased iron stores due to reduced iron utilization and less blood loss compared to younger populations, and iron deficiency anemia is less common than in younger populations. However, anemia of chronic disease is common, and iron overload can occur but is not necessarily more common than iron deficiency.\n\nGiven the typical understanding, the most accurate statement among these is likely A, as iron deficiency is less common than iron overload in older adults.\n\nAnswer: A"}

The question is about the biochemical measurements themselves being misleading, not about dietary intake.\n\nB) Because the accuracy of some laboratory assays may be compromised in samples from people who are sick.  \n- Laboratory assays are generally designed to be accurate regardless of the health status of the person, although some interference can occur. However, this is not the primary reason biochemical indices are misleading in infection or inflammation.\n\nC) Because some metabolic pathways are altered in sick people, which changes their micronutrient requirements.  \n- Illness can indeed alter metabolism and micronutrient requirements, but this alone doesn't explain misleading biochemical indices measured in plasma or serum.\n\nD) Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.  \n- This is the most accurate option. During infection or inflammation, the acute phase response causes changes in the distribution of micronutrients between tissues and plasma. For example, serum ferritin increases because iron is sequestered in storage sites, making serum iron appear low. Similarly, plasma zinc decreases during inflammation due to redistribution. These changes can make plasma or serum concentrations misleading indicators of true micronutrient status.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D"}

Among dietary factors, red meat and dietary fat have been studied extensively, but the results are not consistently conclusive. Fish consumption is generally considered neutral or even protective due to omega-3 fatty acids.

It is accurate and practical for assessing changes in body fat during weight loss.\n\nC) Four-compartment model: This model divides the body into four components—fat, water, protein, and minerals. It is considered the most accurate method for assessing body composition because it accounts for individual variability in body water and mineral content.
