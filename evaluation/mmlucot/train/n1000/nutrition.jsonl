Fatty acid β-oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle for energy production.\n3. Several cofactors and vitamins are involved in the enzymes that catalyze the steps in β-oxidation:\n   - Niacin (Vitamin B3) is a precursor for NAD+ and NADP+, which are important electron carriers in metabolism.\n   - Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is a precursor for FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), which acts as an electron carrier in several oxidation reactions, including the first step of β-oxidation.\n   - Thiamin (Vitamin B1) is essential for carbohydrate metabolism, especially in the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids, but not directly involved in β-oxidation.\n   - Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is important for collagen synthesis, but it is not involved in β-oxidation.\n\n4.

This is a well-known mechanism in physiology.  \n- This statement is correct.\n\nB) Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose.  \n- Fructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion via GLUT5 transporters, whereas glucose is absorbed via active transport (SGLT1).  \n- However, fructose absorption can be slower or less efficient than glucose absorption because it relies on facilitated diffusion which can be saturable.  \n- Typically, glucose absorption is considered more rapid and efficient than fructose.  \n- This statement is likely incorrect.\n\nC) Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.  \n- Galactose is absorbed via the same transporter as glucose (SGLT1), sodium-dependent active transport.  \n- Fructose is absorbed by a different transporter, GLUT5, which is sodium-independent facilitated diffusion.  \n- Therefore, galactose and fructose do NOT share the same transporter.  \n- This statement is incorrect.\n\nD) Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon.  \n- Although the colon does absorb water, the majority of water absorption occurs in the small intestine, especially the jejunum.  \n- The colon absorbs some water to form solid feces, but the bulk of water reabsorption is in the small intestine.  \n- This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most correct statement is A.\n\nAnswer: A"}

The question is about natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils.\n2. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one carbon-carbon double bond.\n3. Vegetable oils are known to contain fatty acids like linoleic acid and linolenic acid.\n   - Linoleic acid: 18 carbon atoms, 2 double bonds, both in cis configuration.\n   - Linolenic acid: 18 carbon atoms, 3 double bonds, all in cis configuration.\n4. The double bonds in natural vegetable oils are predominantly in the cis configuration, not trans.\n5. The number of carbon atoms in these fatty acids is typically 18, not 20.\n6. Option A refers to one double bond (monounsaturated) and 18 carbons. This is more like oleic acid, which is monounsaturated, not polyunsaturated.\n7. Option B mentions 20 carbons and at least two double bonds, which is not typical for common vegetable oil PUFAs.\n8. Option C mentions trans configuration, which is rare in natural vegetable oils; trans fats generally come from hydrogenation.\n9. Option D fits the common knowledge: 18 carbons, at least two double bonds, cis configuration.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n\nAnswer: D"}
{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "Bone mineral accretion\n", "choices": ["Is rapid in the first 10 weeks of foetal life", "Is slow in infancy", "In childhood, adolescence and young adulthood predicts risk of fracture in old age", "Is particularly high after the menopause in women"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "Is rapid in the first 10 weeks of foetal life", "B": "Is slow in infancy", "C": "In childhood, adolescence and young adulthood predicts risk of fracture in old age", "D": "Is particularly high after the menopause in women", "answer": "Let's analyze each option carefully based on knowledge about bone mineral accretion (the process of bone mineral density increase):\n\nA) \"Is rapid in the first 10 weeks of foetal life\"  \n- Bone mineralization begins in fetal life, but the very early fetal period (first 10 weeks) is primarily focused on organogenesis and basic skeletal formation, not rapid mineral accretion. Most mineralization occurs later in gestation, especially in the third trimester. So this option is likely false.\n\nB) \"Is slow in infancy\"  \n- Infancy is actually a period of rapid bone growth and mineral accretion to support the rapid growth of the child. Mineralization is quite active during infancy. So this is false.\n\nC) \"In childhood, adolescence and young adulthood predicts risk of fracture in old age\"  \n- Bone mineral density and peak bone mass achieved during these stages strongly influence lifelong bone health. Higher peak bone mass reduces fracture risk later in life. This statement is correct and well supported by evidence.\n\nD) \"Is particularly high after the menopause in women\"  \n- After menopause, bone resorption exceeds mineral accretion due to decreased estrogen, leading to bone loss rather than accretion. So bone mineral accretion is not high after menopause; it decreases. This option is false.\n\nConclusion: Option C is the correct statement.\n\nAnswer: C"}
