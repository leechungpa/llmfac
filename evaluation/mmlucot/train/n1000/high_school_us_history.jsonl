It was supported by the Democratic President Woodrow Wilson and aligned with the progressive goal of reducing the power of big business and promoting fair competition and consumer interests.\n\nThe Progressive Party in 1912 was formed primarily by Theodore Roosevelt, who ran against both Taft and Wilson. Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\" platform emphasized strong federal regulation of business, social justice, and labor rights. However, Roosevelt's party had split from the Democrats, and Wilson’s platform, known as the \"New Freedom,\" was more focused on tariff reduction and antitrust measures.\n\nThe Underwood-Simmons Tariff was championed by Wilson and Democrats, including many progressives who favored lower tariffs to reduce monopolistic practices and consumer prices. Roosevelt's Progressive Party was more about regulation and reform but not necessarily focused on tariff reductions to the same extent.\n\nGiven this, Progressives of that era, especially those aligned with Wilson and the Democratic Party, would generally endorse the Underwood-Simmons Tariff because it lowered tariffs — a key Democratic and progressive goal at the time.\n\nNow, evaluating the answer choices:\nA) Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\" — The \"Square Deal\" was Roosevelt's earlier domestic program (before the Progressive Party) focused on control of corporations, consumer protection, and conservation, but Roosevelt in 1912 ran under the \"New Nationalism,\" not the \"Square Deal.\"\n\nB) Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties — This is true; the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic initiative to lower tariffs.\n\nC) No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\" — The \"New Nationalism\" was Roosevelt’s platform for the Progressive Party, but the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was supported by Wilson and Democrats, not by Roosevelt's Progressive Party.\n\nD) No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson — The Progressive Party was an opponent of Wilson in 1912, but many progressives within the Democratic Party supported Wilson's tariff reductions.\n\nSince the question asks if the Underwood-Simmons Tariff would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era, it depends on which progressives. The Progressive Party of 1912, led by Roosevelt, was separate from Wilson's Democratic progressives who passed the tariff. The tariff was a Democratic measure supported by Wilson and his progressive allies. So, the best fit answer is that Democrats advocated lower duties, and the tariff would be generally endorsed by progressive Democrats.\n\nAnswer: B"}

Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there.

Anthony, \"Declaration of Rights for Women,\" July 4, 1876\nThe sentiments expressed in the first excerpt by Abigail Adams best exemplify which of the following ideologies?", "choices": ["Second-wave feminism", "Jeffersonian democracy", "Republican motherhood", "Libertarianism"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "Second-wave feminism", "B": "Jeffersonian democracy", "C": "Republican motherhood", "D": "Libertarianism", "answer": "Let's analyze the excerpts and the question carefully.\n\nThe first excerpt is from Abigail Adams in 1776, urging her husband John Adams to \"Remember the Ladies\" while drafting new laws, warning that women will rebel if they are not given a voice or representation. This shows an early call for women's rights and political inclusion during the founding era of the United States.\n\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\n\nA) Second-wave feminism - This refers to the feminist movement primarily in the 1960s-1980s focusing on issues like workplace equality, reproductive rights, and legal inequalities. This is much later than 1776, so unlikely.\n\nB) Jeffersonian democracy - This ideology emphasized agrarianism, states' rights, and a more democratic government for white men. It does not specifically focus on women's rights or equality.\n\nC) Republican motherhood - This ideology emerged after the American Revolution, emphasizing women's role in raising virtuous citizens and educating children in republican values. It acknowledged women's moral and educational influence but did not advocate for political rights or representation like Abigail Adams is doing.\n\nD) Libertarianism - A political philosophy emphasizing individual liberty, minimal government, and free-market principles. While it values individual rights, it is not specifically linked to early calls for women's rights in the 1770s.\n\nAbigail Adams' letter is an early feminist appeal for women to be included in the new laws and political representation. It is not exactly \"Republican motherhood\" because she is demanding political rights, not just moral influence. Second-wave feminism is too late historically. Jeffersonian democracy doesn't focus on women's rights. Libertarianism is unrelated.\n\nThus, none of the options perfectly capture early feminist demands, but the best fit is that Abigail Adams was expressing a proto-feminist ideology focused on women's political representation.\n\nGiven that, the closest match is C) Republican motherhood, since it reflects women's emerging political awareness in the revolutionary era, even if not fully aligned with Adams' demands.\n\nAnswer: C"}

It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,” 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?", "choices": ["African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.", "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.", "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America.", "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.", "B": "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.", "C": "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America.", "D": "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people.", "answer": "Let's analyze each choice in relation to the Spanish conquest of the Americas:\n\nA) African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.  \n- While African slavery became widespread in the Americas, it was not specifically a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.

Florida was not the primary or initial place where African slavery took hold as a direct consequence of Spanish settlement.\n\nB) Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.  \n- Native civilizations in Mexico, such as the Aztecs, had advanced agricultural systems but did not have cattle ranching or wheat cultivation before the Spanish arrived.

To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest.

It describes the persistence of racist attitudes and abuses against freedmen despite emancipation, highlighting the social and legal challenges during Reconstruction.\n\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following specific developments contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15?\"\n\nFederalist #15 is one of the Federalist Papers written by Alexander Hamilton. Its main theme is the weakness of the Articles of Confederation and the need for a stronger central government to maintain order and prevent anarchy.\n\nFederalist #15 argues that under the Articles of Confederation, the United States was unable to enforce laws or maintain order, resulting in chaos and disrespect for law and authority. Hamilton discusses how states were acting independently and how there was no power to compel compliance, which led to domestic disorder and threats from foreign powers.\n\nNow, looking at the choices:\n\nA) Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThis is a well-known issue after the Revolution, where British troops remained in forts in the Northwest Territory, exploiting the weakness of the US under the Articles of Confederation, and it was a point that demonstrated the federal government's inability to enforce treaties or assert authority.\n\nB) Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n\nSpain controlled Florida until 1821, but the US never controlled Florida immediately after the Revolution, so this is historically inaccurate, or at least not relevant to the period of Federalist #15.\n\nC) French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n\nThis is not historically accurate in the post-Revolution period; France was an ally during the Revolution but did not aid Indians in raids afterward.\n\nD) Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n\nThis seems less relevant and less historically significant in terms of Federalist #15.\n\nGiven Hamilton's argument was about the inability of the government under the Articles to enforce treaties and maintain authority, the issue with British forts in the Great Lakes region (A) is the best choice, as it exemplifies the kind of weakness Hamilton was warning about.\n\nAnswer: A"}

O'Sullivan's 1839 essay \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" which is known for articulating the idea of Manifest Destiny. This concept held that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent, spreading its values and government. The language in the passage about a \"magnificent domain of space and time,\" \"a hemisphere,\" and a \"Union of many Republics\" governed by natural and moral law reflects the belief in the inevitability and divine sanction of westward expansion.\n\nLooking at the choices:\nA) Talks about colonists leaving the British Empire due to distance, which is unrelated to the passage.\nB) Discusses women's roles, which is not mentioned or implied in the passage.\nC) Matches the idea of America's expansion being inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\nD) Concerns abolition of slavery, which is not addressed in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the best choice that matches the principle described is C.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Truman discusses how totalitarian regimes thrive in conditions of misery, poverty, and lost hope. This reflects the post-World War II context where the U.S. was concerned about the spread of communism, especially in Europe and Asia, where economic hardship and political instability could allow totalitarian communist governments to gain power.\n\nThe key phrase \"We must keep that hope alive\" and the mention of \"great responsibilities\" imply a proactive stance to prevent the spread of totalitarian regimes by addressing the conditions that allow them to grow.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA) The policy of containment: This was the strategy adopted by the U.S. to prevent the spread of communism by containing it within its existing borders, often through economic and military aid to vulnerable countries. It aligns with the idea of preventing totalitarian regimes from growing by keeping hope alive.\n\nB) The principle of \"massive retaliation\": This was a later Cold War policy focused on the threat of overwhelming nuclear response to Soviet aggression. It is more about military deterrence and less about addressing the root causes like poverty and misery.\n\nC) Participation in the Atlantic Charter: The Atlantic Charter (1941) was a WWII statement of Allied goals for the postwar world. Truman's 1947 speech is after the charter, and this option is less relevant to the passage's context.\n\nD) Embarking on a \"roll-back\" of communism: Roll-back refers to actively pushing back and reducing communist influence, a more aggressive stance than containment. Truman's language suggests prevention and hope rather than aggressive rollback.\n\nTherefore, the passage most directly supports the rationale for the policy of containment.\n\nAnswer: A"}
