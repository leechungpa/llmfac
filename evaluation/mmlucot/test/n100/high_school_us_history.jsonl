They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nWhich of the following pairs of words best characterizes the differences between the approaches of Presidents Lyndon Johnson (1963–1969) and Richard Nixon (1969–1974) to the Vietnam conflict?", "choices": ["Aggression vs. pacifism", "Competency vs. failure", "Insurgence vs. retreat", "Appeasement vs. provocation"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "Aggression vs. pacifism", "B": "Competency vs. failure", "C": "Insurgence vs. retreat", "D": "Appeasement vs. provocation"}

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n—John C.
