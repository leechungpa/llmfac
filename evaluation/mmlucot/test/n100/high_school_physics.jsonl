{"subject": "high_school_physics", "category": "STEM", "question": "A solid sphere (I = 0.06 kg·m^2) spins freely around an axis through its center at an angular speed of 20 rad/s. It is desired to bring the sphere to rest by applying a friction force of magnitude 2.0 N to the sphere’s outer surface, a distance of 0.30 m from the sphere’s center. How much time will it take the sphere to come to rest?", "choices": ["4 s", "2 s", "0.06 s", "0.03 s"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "4 s", "B": "2 s", "C": "0.06 s", "D": "0.03 s"}
