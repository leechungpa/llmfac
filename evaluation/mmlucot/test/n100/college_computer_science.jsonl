{"subject": "college_computer_science", "category": "STEM", "question": "Consider a computer system in which processes can request and release one or more resources. Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released. If a process requests a resource that is already in use, the process enters a queue for that resource, waiting until the resource is available. Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock?", "choices": ["Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority", "Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all", "Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number", "Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting"], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority", "B": "Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all", "C": "Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number", "D": "Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting"}
{"subject": "college_computer_science", "category": "STEM", "question": "Two single-user workstations are attached to the same local area network. On one of these workstations, file pages are accessed over the network from a file server; the average access time per page is 0.1 second. On the other of these workstations, file pages are accessed from a local disk; the average access time per page is 0.05 second. A particular compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. What is the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk, if it is assumed that computation is not overlapped with file access?", "choices": ["1/1", "5/4", "5/3", "10/5"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "1/1", "B": "5/4", "C": "5/3", "D": "10/5"}
