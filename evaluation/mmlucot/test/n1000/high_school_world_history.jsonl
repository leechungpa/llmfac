They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750–1900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?", "choices": ["The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants", "Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas", "The Industrial Revolution", "The colonization of Africa"], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants", "B": "Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas", "C": "The Industrial Revolution", "D": "The colonization of Africa"}
{"subject": "high_school_world_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nMachiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of which of the following?", "choices": ["A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society", "A time of increasing religious devotion among the elite Italian scholars", "A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions", "A time of collegial cooperation between scholars and ecclesiastical authorities in Italy"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society", "B": "A time of increasing religious devotion among the elite Italian scholars", "C": "A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions", "D": "A time of collegial cooperation between scholars and ecclesiastical authorities in Italy"}
{"subject": "high_school_world_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards. Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny…We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSimón de Bolívar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nSimón de Bolívar, the author of the passage, accomplished which of the following?", "choices": ["The first union of independent Latin American states", "The first military victory of the War of 1812", "The first military victory of the Spanish-American War", "The first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent"], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "The first union of independent Latin American states", "B": "The first military victory of the War of 1812", "C": "The first military victory of the Spanish-American War", "D": "The first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent"}
