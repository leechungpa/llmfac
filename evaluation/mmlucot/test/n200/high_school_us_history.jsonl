{"subject": "high_school_us_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n—John C.

{"subject": "high_school_us_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?", "choices": ["Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.", "The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.", "Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.", "Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate."], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.", "B": "The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.", "C": "Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.", "D": "Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate."}
