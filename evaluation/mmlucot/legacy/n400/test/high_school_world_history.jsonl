When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice.

It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power.

He emphasizes that neo-colonialism is about financial power being used to impoverish less developed countries, and that non-alignment involves accepting foreign investment but under national control.\n\n2. **Key Point**: The foreign investment from capitalist countries is allowed but must align with national plans to avoid exploitation and loss of sovereignty (\"The issue is one of power\").\n\n3. **The Question**: What would most directly result from foreign investment from capitalist countries as mentioned?\n\n4. **Answer Options**:\n\n   - **A) The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers**  \n     Formal control (direct colonial rule) was largely abolished by the 1960s. Neo-colonialism is about indirect control through economic means, not formal political control. So this is unlikely.\n\n   - **B) The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment**  \n     While foreign investment might influence regimes, Nkrumah's argument centers on loss of power and control, not democratic success. Many neo-colonial states struggled with political instability, so this is unlikely.\n\n   - **C) The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism**  \n     Foreign investment from capitalist countries often leads to economic integration and cultural influence via global consumer goods and practices. This fits the idea of capitalist investment spreading culture and economic ties.\n\n   - **D) The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies**  \n     Nkrumah argues the opposite; neo-colonialism leads to loss of control and potential unrest. So this is unlikely.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The most direct result of foreign capitalist investment, as per the passage and historical context, is **C) the development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism**. This fits with capitalist investment integrating economies and cultures globally.\n\nAnswer: C"}

{"subject": "high_school_world_history", "category": "Humanities", "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

Both empires were known for tolerance and allowing local traditions.\n\nB) The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works.\n- The Persians built extensive public works (roads, canals). The Mongols were less known for monument-building; they were more nomadic and focused on military conquest and administration. This option contrasts the two but may overstate Mongol monument-building.\n\nC) Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.\n- Historically, neither empire is noted for significantly improving women's status broadly; this is unlikely to be accurate.\n\nD) The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion.\n- The Mongols generally tolerated many religions but did not create a new syncretic religion. Persians had Zoroastrianism, which is monotheistic. This statement is inaccurate regarding Mongols.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate comparison is option A.\n\nAnswer: A"}

Source 2 focuses on getting goods (including slaves). There is some diplomacy, but the tone of Source 1 suggests tension.

This supports this choice.\n\nC) Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.\n- The letters do not mention regulation; Source 1 complains about kidnapping, which suggests lack of control, and Source 2 instructs to procure goods including slaves by any means. This does not show regulation.\n\nD) Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.\n- Source 2 suggests trade was active, seeking slaves, copper, and ivory; Source 1 shows people being taken as slaves.

The excerpt is from Ibn Battuta's travels in the 14th century, describing Mongol-ruled China:\n   - Mongol rule in China (Yuan Dynasty) was religiously tolerant: various religious groups (Muslims, Jews, Christians, etc.) had their own communities, places of worship, and were treated with respect.\n   - The Mongols in China maintained a complex, bureaucratic, and cosmopolitan administration.\n   - The city of Hangzhou is described as well-organized, with diverse religious groups coexisting, and the Mongols apparently integrated into the existing Chinese bureaucratic structure.\n\n2. The question asks how Mongol administration of Russia differed from Mongol administration in China during roughly the same period (600 CE to 1450 CE):\n   - Mongols ruled Russia through the Golden Horde.\n   - Mongol rule in Russia is known for heavy tribute extraction from the Russian principalities.\n   - Unlike in China, the Mongols did not attempt to impose a Chinese-style bureaucratic state in Russia; governance was more indirect.\n   - Russian Orthodox Christianity was generally tolerated, but the Mongols did not show the same level of religious pluralism as in China.\n   - Mongol rule in Russia was often seen as oppressive, with heavy taxation and less favorable views from the subjects.\n   - There was trade between Russia and China, but the Mongols in Russia did not particularly stimulate Russian exports to China, nor did they curtail Chinese economic activity (which was largely independent).\n\n3. Analyzing the options:\n   - A) \"was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions\"\n     This aligns with the known difference: Mongols in Russia mainly tolerated Orthodox Christianity, and were less pluralistic compared to China.\n   \n   - B) \"relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state\"\n     This is also true: Mongols in Russia extracted tribute; in China, they kept a bureaucratic system.\n   \n   - C) \"was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\"\n     This is false; Mongol rule in Russia was generally resented; China had some unrest but also complex governance.\n   \n   - D) \"stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity\"\n     This is false; Mongols in China did not curtail economic activity but often promoted trade.\n\n4. Both A and B are factually accurate, but the question asks how \"Mongol administration of its Russian domains differed in that...,\" so the best answer highlights a key administrative difference.\n\nBetween A and B:\n- A focuses on religious tolerance differences.\n- B focuses on administrative style and economic extraction.\n\nGiven the excerpt emphasizes religious tolerance, but the question is about administration differences, B is a stronger answer because it highlights the administrative methods (tribute vs. bureaucracy) which are clear and major differences.\n\nAnswer: B"}
