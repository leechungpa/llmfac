{"subject": "human_aging", "category": "Other", "question": "If you believe that changes occur slowly and steadily throughout life, you would be holding the _____ side of this view of development.", "choices": ["Mechanistic", "Organismic", "Continuity", "Stability"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "Mechanistic", "B": "Organismic", "C": "Continuity", "D": "Stability", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is about a view of development related to how changes occur over time.\n2. It states that these changes happen \"slowly and steadily throughout life.\"\n3. We need to identify which term corresponds to this idea of continuous, gradual change.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA) Mechanistic - This perspective often views development as a result of external stimuli and tends to emphasize gradual and continuous change, like a machine reacting to inputs. It can relate to continuous change but it's more about the nature of development (reactive vs active).\n\nB) Organismic - This perspective generally sees development as driven by internal forces and often involves stage-like, qualitative changes (discontinuous change), not slow and steady.\n\nC) Continuity - This term directly refers to development occurring gradually and continuously, without abrupt changes or stages.\n\nD) Stability - This refers to traits or behaviors remaining consistent over time, not necessarily about change occurring gradually.\n\nGiven these definitions, the view that changes occur slowly and steadily corresponds to the \"Continuity\" side of development.\n\nAnswer: C"}
