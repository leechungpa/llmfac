While style is important in the auto industry, the Prius and hybrid Civic's main claim to fame is not style but technology focused on efficiency.\n- Option B mentions social pressure to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles with fewer dangerous emissions. This aligns well with why hybrid cars were developed: to address environmental concerns and fuel economy.\n- Option C suggests the desire of engineers to make interesting products. While engineers may be motivated by innovation, the primary driver for hybrids is environmental and regulatory pressures.\n- Option D talks about the realization that Japanese people didn't need large, high-speed cars. While the market in Japan favors smaller cars, the Prius and Civic's hybrid technology is more about efficiency and emissions than just size or speed preferences.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is B: social pressure to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles with fewer dangerous emissions.\n\nAnswer: B"}
{"subject": "marketing", "category": "Other", "question": "Which type of retailer involves comparatively low prices as a major selling point combined with the reduced costs of doing business?", "choices": ["Discount retailers.", "Convenience stores.", "Category killer stores.", "Limited line retailers."], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "Discount retailers.", "B": "Convenience stores.", "C": "Category killer stores.", "D": "Limited line retailers.", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step-by-step:\n\n1. The question asks for a type of retailer that uses comparatively low prices as a major selling point.\n2. It also mentions that these retailers achieve this by having reduced costs of doing business.\n3. Let's consider each option:\n\n- A) Discount retailers: These stores focus on selling goods at lower prices, often by operating with lower margins and reduced operating costs. They rely on high volume and cost efficiency.\n- B) Convenience stores: These generally offer convenience and quick access but often have higher prices due to location and smaller scale.\n- C) Category killer stores: These are large specialty stores dominating a particular product category, often with a wide selection and competitive prices, but the emphasis is on category dominance rather than just low price.\n- D) Limited line retailers: These specialize in a narrow product line, but price is not necessarily their main focus.\n\n4. The description fits best with discount retailers, who emphasize low prices and operate efficiently to keep costs down.\n\nAnswer: A"}
