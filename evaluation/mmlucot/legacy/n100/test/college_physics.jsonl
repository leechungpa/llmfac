A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?", "choices": ["0.24 mJ", "0.38 mJ", "0.48 mJ", "0.75 mJ"], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "0.24 mJ", "B": "0.38 mJ", "C": "0.48 mJ", "D": "0.75 mJ", "answer": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given information:**\n   - Mass, \\( m = 0.30 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n   - Displacement from equilibrium, \\( x = 0.030 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n   - Speed at equilibrium position, \\( v = 0.040 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n   - The spring is massless and horizontal, no friction.\n\n2. **What is asked?**\n   - Find the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\n3. **Relevant physics concepts:**\n   - The total mechanical energy in a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM) is constant and is the sum of kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE).\n   - At the maximum displacement, the block has maximum potential energy (all energy stored in the spring) and zero kinetic energy.\n   - At the equilibrium position, the spring's potential energy is zero (since displacement is zero), and the block has maximum kinetic energy.\n   - The total mechanical energy \\( E \\) can be calculated either from the kinetic energy at the equilibrium or from the potential energy at maximum displacement.\n\n4. **Calculate total mechanical energy from kinetic energy at equilibrium:**\n   \\[\n   E = KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.30 \\times (0.040)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E = 0.15 \\times 0.0016 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check with potential energy at maximum displacement (optional but good for confirmation):**\n   The maximum potential energy stored in the spring is equal to the total mechanical energy:\n   \\[\n   E = PE = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n   \\]\n   However, \\( k \\) (spring constant) is not given, so we cannot directly calculate this way.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Using kinetic energy at equilibrium position, the total mechanical energy is 0.24 mJ.\n\nAnswer: A"}
