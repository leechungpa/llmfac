The question involves a fusion reaction where two hydrogen isotopes fuse to create an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and a neutron.\n\n2. In such fusion reactions (for example, deuterium-tritium fusion), the mass of the reactants is slightly greater than the mass of the products, leading to a release of energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).\n\n3. The energy released shows up primarily as kinetic energy of the products because the alpha particle and neutron are moving very fast after the reaction.\n\n4. Among the products, the neutron typically carries off a significant portion of the energy because it is uncharged and can escape easily, taking energy with it.\n\n5. The alpha particle also carries kinetic energy but generally less than the neutron.\n\n6. Gamma radiation (high-energy photons) can be released in nuclear reactions, but in this specific fusion reaction, the bulk of the energy is not emitted as gamma rays.\n\n7. Therefore, most of the energy is in the form of kinetic energy of the neutron.\n\nAnswer: C"}
{"subject": "conceptual_physics", "category": "STEM", "question": "Thermal convection involves mainly", "choices": ["radiant energy", "fluids", "insulators", "All of these"], "answer_idx": "B", "A": "radiant energy", "B": "fluids", "C": "insulators", "D": "All of these", "answer": "Let's break down the question: \"Thermal convection involves mainly\"\n\n1. Understand what thermal convection is: \n   - Thermal convection is a mode of heat transfer.\n   - It occurs when heat is transferred by the movement of fluid (liquid or gas).\n   - The fluid gets heated, becomes less dense, rises, and cooler fluid sinks, creating a convection current.\n\n2. Analyze each option:\n   A) Radiant energy: This refers to heat transfer via electromagnetic waves (radiation), not by fluid movement.\n   B) Fluids: Since convection involves movement of fluids (liquids or gases), this matches the definition.\n   C) Insulators: Insulators resist heat flow and do not participate in convection.\n   D) All of these: Since radiant energy and insulators are not involved in convection, this cannot be correct.\n\nTherefore, the main involvement in thermal convection is fluids.\n\nAnswer: B"}
