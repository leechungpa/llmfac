The question is about picornavirus replication, specifically as a positive strand RNA virus.\n2. Picornaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.\n3. Positive strand RNA viruses have RNA genomes that can directly act as mRNA upon entering the host cell.\n4. Therefore, the viral RNA can be directly translated by host ribosomes without the need for transcription.\n5. Typically, in picornavirus replication, the viral RNA is translated into a large polyprotein, which is then cleaved into functional viral proteins.\n6. Let's evaluate each option:\n   - A) Virions carry RNA transcriptase enzyme into the cell: This is characteristic of negative strand RNA viruses or retroviruses, not positive strand RNA viruses like picornaviruses.\n   - B) The virion RNA is translated into a single large polyprotein: This matches known mechanisms of picornavirus replication.\n   - C) The virion RNA acting as mRNA: This is true and is a hallmark of positive strand RNA viruses.\n   - D) The virus exits by apoptosis of the cell: Virus exit mechanisms vary and picornaviruses typically cause cell lysis rather than apoptosis.\n\nBetween options B and C, both are correct statements related to picornaviruses, but the question asks which is particularly typified by picornavirus replication as a positive strand RNA virus. The key feature is that the RNA acts as mRNA (option C). The translation into a polyprotein (option B) is a subsequent step and also characteristic.\n\nHowever, the fundamental defining characteristic of positive strand RNA viruses is that their RNA can act directly as mRNA, so option C is more fundamental.\n\nAnswer: C"}

Parvoviruses are small DNA viruses. One well-known parvovirus in humans is Parvovirus B19, which causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease). It primarily spreads via respiratory secretions.\n\n2. Option A: \"Transfusion blood is screened.\"  \n   Parvovirus B19 can be transmitted via blood transfusion. Screening donated blood for parvovirus DNA can reduce transmission through transfusion. This is a valid method used especially in immunocompromised patients.\n\n3. Option B: \"Vaccine has been developed.\"  \n   To date, there is no widely available vaccine for human parvovirus B19. Vaccine development has been attempted but no approved vaccine exists.\n\n4. Option C: \"A range of new antivirals.\"  \n   There are no specific antivirals approved for parvovirus infections. Treatment is mostly supportive.\n\n5. Option D: \"Social distancing.\"  \n   Since parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory droplets, social distancing can theoretically reduce transmission, but it is not a primary targeted control measure specific to parvovirus infections.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate targeted measure to reduce disease caused by parvovirus is screening transfusion blood to prevent transmission.\n\nAnswer: A"}
