The question asks about Kant's \"categorical imperative,\" a key concept in Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy.\n2. Kant's categorical imperative is a principle that dictates that one should act only according to maxims that can be universally appliedâ€”that is, ones that everyone could follow consistently.\n3. Breaking down the options:\n   - A) \"You must not consciously harm another person.\" While Kant's ethics involve respecting persons, this is more a consequence of his imperative rather than the imperative itself.\n   - B) \"You must always act in the best interests of the community.\" Kant's imperative is about universalizability and duty, not necessarily about community welfare as a primary goal.\n   - C) \"You must treat human beings as means rather than ends.\" This is actually the opposite of Kant's teaching; he insisted that humans must never be treated merely as means, but always also as ends.\n   - D) \"You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\" This directly reflects the universalizability principle of the categorical imperative, that one should act according to maxims that could be universal laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation aligns with option D.\n\nAnswer: D"}
