The first sentence states: \"There are those who use predicate variables; the values of these variables are attributes.\" This seems to be an introductory statement, presenting a fact about the use of predicate variables.\n\n2. The second sentence states: \"Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\" This provides a general claim or assertion about the necessity of predicates in sentences.\n\n3. The third sentence states: \"The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\" This is an explanatory or supportive statement giving an example of a predicate used for exposition.\n\n4. The fourth sentence states: \"If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.\" This is a conditional statement providing a recommendation or guideline for clarity in logic.\n\nThe conclusion of an argument is typically the main point the author wants to establish or the claim supported by the premises.\n\n- The first three sentences seem to be premises or background information.\n- The last sentence gives a recommendation that follows from the previous points about predicate variables, attributes, and predicates.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is likely the last sentence: the recommendation about using recognizable variables and distinctive names to maintain clarity.\n\nAnswer: D"}
