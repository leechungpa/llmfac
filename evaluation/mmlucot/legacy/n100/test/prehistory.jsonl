This method is well-known as a key Inca agricultural innovation to increase arable land.\n\nC) Slashing and burning: This method involves cutting and burning forested areas to clear land for farming, more typical of tropical lowland agriculture, not the high Andes.\n\nD) Fertilizing: Fertilizing improves soil fertility but does not increase the amount of land available for farming.\n\nTherefore, the practice that allowed the Incas to greatly increase arable land was terracing.\n\nAnswer: B"}

The question is about the genetic studies of the two primary varieties of rice: japonica (short-grained) and indica (long-grained).\n2. The key point is what the genetic relationships between these two varieties and their wild ancestors suggest about their domestication.\n3. Option A suggests japonica and indica are more closely related to each other than to their local wild ancestors, implying a recent common domestication in East Asia.\n4. Option B suggests each is more closely related to their local wild ancestors than to each other, implying separate domestications in East Asia and South Asia.\n5. Option C suggests they are unrelated and domesticated independently in East Asia and Western Europe, which is unlikely since rice is not traditionally associated with Western Europe domestication.\n6. Option D suggests domestication is very recent (within 2,000 years), which contradicts archaeological evidence indicating rice domestication occurred much earlier (around 8,000-9,000 years ago).\n\nScientific consensus based on genetic evidence supports that japonica and indica rice varieties were domesticated separately from different wild ancestors in different regions of Asia. This means each variety is genetically closer to its local wild progenitor than to each other, supporting independent domestication events.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B"}
