The question asks where fertilization normally occurs in humans.\n2. Fertilization is the process where the sperm and egg unite to form a zygote.\n3. The ovary (A) is where eggs (ova) are produced, but fertilization does not occur there.\n4. The fallopian tube (B), also called the oviduct, is the site where the sperm typically meets the egg and fertilization happens.\n5. The uterus (C) is where the fertilized egg implants and develops, but fertilization itself does not occur there.\n6. The placenta (D) is an organ that develops later to provide nutrients to the fetus and is not involved in fertilization.\n\nTherefore, fertilization normally occurs in the fallopian tube.\n\nAnswer: B"}

Organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts allow compartmentalization, which optimizes metabolic pathways by isolating incompatible reactions and concentrating substrates and enzymes.\n\nB) \"Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have no structural similarities.\"\n- This is false. Both have cell membranes, ribosomes, DNA, cytoplasm, etc. They share fundamental cellular structures.\n\nC) \"The organelles in larger eukaryotic cells took care of the problems of having a larger surface area–to–volume ratio.\"\n- The problem with larger cells is actually a smaller surface area to volume ratio, which limits the rate of diffusion across the membrane. Organelles help compartmentalize but do not directly solve the surface area to volume ratio problem. Instead, adaptations like folding membranes or increasing transport proteins help.\n\nD) \"Eukaryotic cells are able to multiply faster based on their more complex structure.\"\n- This is false. Generally, prokaryotic cells multiply faster due to simpler structure and faster division processes like binary fission. Eukaryotic cells have more complex division processes (mitosis), which take longer.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is A.\n\nAnswer: A"}
