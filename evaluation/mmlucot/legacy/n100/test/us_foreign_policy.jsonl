The Cold War did not end American exceptionalism; if anything, it redefined or reinforced it.\n   - **B) Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world':** This is true as the U.S. framed itself as the defender of freedom.\n   - **C) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism:** Also true because realpolitik and contradictions in U.S. foreign policy sometimes conflicted with exceptionalist ideals.\n   - **D) Both b and c:** Since both B and C are valid and not mutually exclusive, this option seems the most comprehensive and accurate.\n\nAnswer: D"}

The question asks about the policies that are part of a grand strategy called Offshore Balancing.\n2. Offshore Balancing is a strategy in U.S. foreign policy that focuses on maintaining regional balances of power, primarily through indirect influence rather than direct military intervention.\n3. It emphasizes:\n   - Avoiding permanent military commitments or alliances.\n   - Encouraging regional powers to take responsibility for their own security.\n   - Intervening directly only when a single power threatens to dominate a key region.\n4. Now let's evaluate the options:\n\nA) \"Maintaining a balance between the United States and other countries and not entering into alliances\" - Offshore Balancing does emphasize maintaining balances of power, but it does not completely reject alliances. It tends to avoid deep, permanent alliances but may tolerate temporary ones. So this is partially correct but not fully capturing the essence.\n\nB) \"Investing equally in domestic and international security with balanced protection against terrorism and other states\" - This option emphasizes domestic vs. international balance and protection against terrorism, which is not the core focus of Offshore Balancing. Offshore Balancing is more about power balances and less about equal investment or terrorism focus.\n\nC) \"Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally and require other states to meet their own security burdens.\" - This fits well with Offshore Balancing. The strategy accepts multipolarity, calls for the U.S. to be more restrained internationally, and encourages other countries to carry their own security burdens unless a major power threatens regional balance.\n\nD) \"Isolate the US from the international system and not seek global power\" - This is closer to isolationism, not Offshore Balancing. Offshore Balancing does not mean withdrawal from global influence but a selective engagement.\n\nConclusion: Option C best captures the grand strategy of Offshore Balancing.\n\nAnswer: C"}
