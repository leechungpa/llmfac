And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&…\n[Later], when Cortés learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him.

The passage describes the conquistadores searching for and dividing gold, with a portion taken by the emperor (the emperor's fifths) and by Cortés himself before the soldiers received their shares.\n\n2. The soldiers complain about the distribution, and Cortés enforces the collection of gold under threat of punishment, demanding a share back (\"one third was to be returned to him\").\n\n3. This reflects a system where wealth (gold) is collected and controlled by the ruling authority (the emperor and Cortés), and the accumulation of wealth (especially precious metals) is seen as a source of power.\n\n4. The question asks: What economic policy does this system represent?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA) Protectionism – This is about protecting domestic industries by limiting imports, which is unrelated to the passage.\n\nB) Laissez-faire – This means minimal government interference in economic matters, which contradicts the forced sharing and control described.\n\nC) Mercantilism – This is an economic policy prevalent in the 16th-18th centuries, emphasizing the accumulation of wealth (especially gold and silver), state control over resources, and exporting more than importing to build national power.\n\nD) Supply-side – An economic theory focusing on stimulating production by reducing taxes and regulation, not relevant here.\n\nGiven the context—state control over gold, the emperor's share, and the mercantile extraction of wealth—the driving philosophy is clearly mercantilism.\n\nAnswer: C"}

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n—Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?", "choices": ["Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.", "Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.", "Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.", "Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels."], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.", "B": "Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.", "C": "Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.", "D": "Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.", "answer": "Let's break down the question step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is about a quote from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which highlights the cruelty of nature and questions the optimistic Enlightenment idea of the \"best of possible worlds.\"\n\n2. The question asks which Enlightenment philosophe questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given.\n\n3. The Romantic Movement was a reaction against the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and rationality. Romantics emphasized emotion, nature, and individualism.\n\n4. Let's analyze each option in relation to the question:\n\n   A) Jean-Jacques Rousseau: He is known for his belief that society corrupts the natural goodness of individuals (\"noble savage\" concept). He emphasized emotion, nature, and the importance of individual experience, which aligns with ideas that led to Romanticism. Rousseau questioned the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and progress.\n\n   B) Baron Montesquieu: Known for his ideas on the separation of powers in government and political theory, not specifically for questioning reason or starting Romanticism.\n\n   C) Mary Wollstonecraft: A strong advocate for women’s rights and rational education for women, promoting reason rather than questioning it emotionally. She was more focused on equality and rationality than on Romanticism.\n\n   D) Adam Smith: Known for his economic theories and moral philosophy, especially the \"invisible hand\" and sympathy in economics, but not for initiating Romanticism or explicitly questioning reason in the way described.\n\n5. Given the rationale that the Romantic Movement began as a reaction to the overemphasis on reason — Rousseau’s ideas about society corrupting the natural goodness and his emphasis on emotion and nature best fit this context.\n\nAnswer: A"}
