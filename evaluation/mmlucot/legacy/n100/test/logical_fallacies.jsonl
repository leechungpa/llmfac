The question asks about the fallacy known as \"Evading burden of proof.\"\n2. The burden of proof is the obligation to provide evidence or reasoning to support one's claim.\n3. Evading the burden of proof means avoiding or shifting this obligation, often by demanding the opponent prove their claim instead or by asserting something without evidence.\n4. Let's consider the options:\n\n- A) Extension: This term is not commonly associated with burden of proof or logical fallacies in this context.\n- B) Appeal to ignorance: This fallacy occurs when it is argued that a proposition is true because it has not been proven false, or vice versa. This is closely related to evading the burden of proof because it shifts the burden onto the opponent.\n- C) Complex question: This fallacy involves asking a question that presupposes something not established or forces a certain answer, but it is not directly about burden of proof.\n- D) Complex proposition: This is not a standard name of a fallacy related to evading burden of proof.\n\nHence, the fallacy most closely related to evading burden of proof is \"Appeal to ignorance.\"\n\nAnswer: B"}
