The question asks: What is an \"act jure gestionis\"?\n\n2. The term \"jure gestionis\" comes from international law and state immunity doctrine:\n   - \"Acta jure imperii\" refers to sovereign or governmental acts, i.e., actions performed by a state as a sovereign.\n   - \"Acta jure gestionis\" refers to acts performed by a state in a private or commercial capacity, not as a sovereign.\n\n3. Therefore, an act jure gestionis is an act undertaken by a state in its private or commercial capacity, not an act of sovereign authority.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA) Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity  \n- This aligns perfectly with the definition: actions by the state as a private party.\n\nB) All purchases by the State are acts jure gestionis  \n- While purchases are often private acts, the statement \"all purchases\" may be too broad. Some purchases might be sovereign in nature, depending on context.\n\nC) All acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis  \n- State corporations often act in a commercial capacity, but the statement says \"all acts,\" which may be too broad. Also, the question is about acts by States, not corporations.\n\nD) All conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jus gestionis  \n- The personal conduct of officials in their private capacity is not really categorized under state acts jure gestionis.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate and generally accepted definition is option A.\n\nAnswer: A"}

The question asks about the \"protective principle of jurisdiction\" in international law.\n2. Jurisdiction refers to the authority of a state to make and enforce laws.\n3. There are several bases for jurisdiction recognized in international law, including territoriality, nationality, passive personality, protective principle, and universality.\n4. The protective principle allows a state to assert jurisdiction over conduct outside its territory that threatens its security, governmental functions, or other vital interests.\n5. Let's examine the options:\n   - A) \"It is jurisdiction based on the harm to national interests by conduct committed abroad\" aligns well with the protective principle, as it covers acts abroad that threaten a state's security or vital interests.\n   - B) \"It is jurisdiction in order to protect one's nationals abroad\" corresponds more to the passive personality principle.\n   - C) \"It is jurisdiction in order to protect international human rights\" is more related to universal jurisdiction.\n   - D) \"It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender\" refers to the nationality principle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nAnswer: A"}
