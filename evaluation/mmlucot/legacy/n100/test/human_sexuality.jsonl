It generally does not use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation.\"\n\n- B) Psychoanalytic theory: This theory, developed by Freud, emphasizes unconscious desires, conflicts, and developmental stages. It doesn't primarily use \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" as key concepts.\n\n- C) Script theory: This theory suggests that people learn scripts or sequences of behavior from cultural contexts, which guide their actions. While it involves learned behaviors, it does not primarily emphasize \"modelling\" and \"imitation.\"\n\n- D) Social learning theory: This theory, developed by Bandura, explicitly involves learning behaviors through observing others, using concepts like \"modelling\" and \"imitation.\" It explains how exposure to stimuli, such as erotica, can lead to learned behaviors by observing and mimicking.\n\nGiven these considerations, the theory that uses \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain behavior changes due to exposure is Social learning theory.\n\nAnswer: D"}
{"subject": "human_sexuality", "category": "Social Sciences", "question": "Which of the following is removed when a male is circumcised?", "choices": ["sunna", "corpus spongiosum", "septum", "prepuce"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "sunna", "B": "corpus spongiosum", "C": "septum", "D": "prepuce", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The question asks what is removed during male circumcision.\n2. Circumcision is a surgical procedure involving the removal of a specific part of the male genitalia.\n3. The corpus spongiosum is a spongy tissue surrounding the urethra in the penis, not removed during circumcision.\n4. The septum is a partition structure, usually referring to nasal or cardiac anatomy, not related to circumcision.\n5. The prepuce is the medical term for the foreskin, the fold of skin that covers the head of the penis.\n6. \"Sunna\" is a term sometimes used to refer to a specific type of circumcision or procedure but is not an anatomical structure.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is the prepuce, the foreskin that is removed during circumcision.\n\nAnswer: D"}
