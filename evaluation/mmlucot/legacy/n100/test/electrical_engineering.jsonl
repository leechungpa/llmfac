The voltmeter has a full scale (maximum) reading of 100 V.\n2. The guaranteed accuracy is 2% of full scale reading.\n   - This means the maximum possible error (limiting error) in volts is 2% of 100 V = 2 V.\n3. The voltage measured is 75 V.\n4. The question asks for the limiting error in percentage relative to the measured voltage (75 V).\n5. Limiting error in volts = 2 V.\n6. Limiting error as a percentage of the measured voltage = (Limiting error / Measured voltage) × 100%\n   = (2 / 75) × 100%\n   = 2.6667 %\n\nTherefore, the limiting error in percentage is approximately 2.66%.\n\nAnswer: B"}

The question asks for the unit of magnetic flux.\n2. Magnetic flux (Φ) is a measure of the total magnetic field (B) passing through a given area (A). It is mathematically expressed as Φ = B × A × cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the surface.\n3. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the Weber (Wb).\n4. Let's consider the options:\n   - A) Newton: Unit of force, not related to magnetic flux.\n   - B) Ampere turn: Unit related to magnetomotive force (MMF), not magnetic flux.\n   - C) Weber: Correct unit of magnetic flux.\n   - D) Tesla: Unit of magnetic flux density (magnetic field strength), not flux itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Weber.\n\nAnswer: C"}
