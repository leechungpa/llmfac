The farmer buys a tractor for $40,000.\n2. The tractor is expected to be used for 20 years.\n3. The salvage value (value at the end of 20 years) is expected to be $10,000.\n4. We need to find the straight-line depreciation for the first year.\n\n**Straight-line depreciation** is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Depreciation per year} = \\frac{\\text{Cost} - \\text{Salvage Value}}{\\text{Useful life in years}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n\\frac{40,000 - 10,000}{20} = \\frac{30,000}{20} = 1,500\n\\]\n\nSo, the straight-line depreciation for the first year is $1,500.\n\nAnswer: A"}
