The probability of a value x is equal to f(x).\"**\n\n- For continuous distributions, the probability of any single point (exact value x) is actually zero.\n- The density function f(x) gives the likelihood density, but probability is computed over intervals, not points.\n- So, even if f(x) is nonzero, P(X = x) = 0 for continuous distributions.\n- Thus, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\nBoth statements are false.\n\nAnswer: B"}
{"subject": "machine_learning", "category": "STEM", "question": "You've just finished training a decision tree for spam classification, and it is getting abnormally bad performance on both your training and test sets. You know that your implementation has no bugs, so what could be causing the problem?", "choices": ["Your decision trees are too shallow.", "You need to increase the learning rate.", "You are overfitting.", "None of the above."], "answer_idx": "A", "A": "Your decision trees are too shallow.", "B": "You need to increase the learning rate.", "C": "You are overfitting.", "D": "None of the above.", "answer": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. The decision tree is performing poorly on **both** the training and test sets.\n2. Poor performance on the **training set** indicates the model is not able to capture the underlying patterns in the training data.\n3. If the model was overfitting, it would perform well on training data but poorly on test data.\n4. Since the model is bad on training data, it is likely **underfitting**.\n5. Decision trees that are too shallow have limited depth and thus limited capacity to capture complex patterns, leading to underfitting.\n6. Increasing the learning rate is relevant for gradient boosting or other iterative methods, but standard decision trees don't have a learning rate parameter.\n7. Overfitting means the model fits training data too closely and fails to generalize, which contradicts the poor training performance here.\n8. Therefore, the most plausible cause is that the decision trees are too shallow.\n\nAnswer: A"}
