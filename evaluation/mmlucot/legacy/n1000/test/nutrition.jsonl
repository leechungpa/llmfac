Vegetarians generally consume higher fiber, so they tend to have lower incidence of diverticular disease.\n\nStep 2: Which disease(s) is/are not less frequent among vegetarians?\n\nResearch indicates that respiratory diseases are not significantly less frequent among vegetarians than non-vegetarians; the frequency is about the same or varies with other factors.\n\nColorectal cancer, IHD, and diverticular disease are generally less frequent among vegetarians.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Respiratory diseases.\n\nAnswer: A"}

However, while PER is widely used, it has limitations because rat amino acid requirements differ from humans. For example, rats have a higher requirement for sulfur-containing amino acids, so some proteins may appear of lower quality for rats than for humans. Therefore, PER is not always a perfect predictor for human protein quality.\n\nB) The rat net protein-utilisation assay (NPU) measures the proportion of ingested nitrogen retained in the body. Although NPU provides useful information, it also has limitations due to species differences and does not fully reflect human protein utilization. It is not considered the best method for assessing protein quality in humans.\n\nC) Animal growth assays, including rat PER, tend to underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition, primarily because animals like rats have different amino acid requirements and metabolism compared to humans.

Nutrients that have been studied for their role in cognitive health include omega-3 fatty acids (N-3), omega-6 fatty acids (N-6), phytochemicals (plant compounds with antioxidant properties), and saturated fats.\n4. Omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA found in fish oil, have substantial evidence supporting their role in brain health and cognitive function.

This is a controversial finding but has been reported.\n\nB) \"During puberty seems to be associated with higher bone mineral density in later life\"  \n- Milk provides calcium and vitamin D, which are important for bone development during growth phases like puberty. Increased milk consumption during puberty is generally thought to support higher bone mineral density later.\n\nC) \"Is consistently associated with a lower rate of fractures\"  \n- Evidence is mixed and not consistent. Some studies show benefits, others show no effect or even negative effects regarding fracture rates. So \"consistently\" is a strong word and likely not accurate.\n\nD) \"In countries with the highest rate of fracture suggests that milk consumption is beneficial to the skeleton.\"  \n- Countries with high milk consumption sometimes also have high fracture rates (e.g., Scandinavian countries), which complicates the assumption that milk is beneficial in those populations.\n\nGiven this, the most accurate and nuanced statement is A: some studies have reported an association between greater milk consumption and higher fracture incidence and mortality, although this is not universally accepted.\n\nAnswer: A"}
{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "Inviduals suffering from inhalant allergies may also react to cross- reacting food allergens. A person suffering from a natural latex allergy might not react to one of the following allergens\n", "choices": ["avocado", "mango", "peach", "figs"], "answer_idx": "D", "A": "avocado", "B": "mango", "C": "peach", "D": "figs", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The topic is about cross-reactivity between inhalant allergies and food allergens.\n2. The specific allergy mentioned is a natural latex allergy.\n3. We need to identify which of the listed food allergens a person with a natural latex allergy might NOT react to.\n4. Natural latex allergy is known to cross-react with certain fruits due to similar proteins. This is called latex-fruit syndrome.\n5. Common fruits involved in latex-fruit syndrome include avocado, banana, mango, chestnut, and sometimes figs.\n6. The options given are avocado, mango, peach, and figs.\n7. Avocado, mango, and figs are well-documented for cross-reactivity with latex.\n8. Peach, however, is less commonly associated with latex allergy cross-reactivity; it is more often linked to pollen allergies (birch pollen and others) but not strongly with latex.\n   \nTherefore, a person with natural latex allergy might NOT react to peach among these options.\n\nAnswer: D"}
{"subject": "nutrition", "category": "Other", "question": "Fats normally contain triacylglycerols at concentrations of:\n", "choices": ["75-95%", "50- 75%", "> 95%", "< 50%"], "answer_idx": "C", "A": "75-95%", "B": "50- 75%", "C": "> 95%", "D": "< 50%", "answer": "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. The question asks about the typical concentration of triacylglycerols (also called triglycerides) in fats.\n\n2. Triacylglycerols are the main components of fats and oils. They are esters derived from glycerol and three fatty acids.\n\n3. In most natural fats and oils, triacylglycerols make up the majority of the composition, usually more than 90%.\n\n4. Minor components in fats include free fatty acids, phospholipids, sterols, and other lipids, but these are generally present in much smaller amounts.\n\n5. Considering this, the concentration of triacylglycerols in fats is typically very high, commonly greater than 95%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nAnswer: C"}
