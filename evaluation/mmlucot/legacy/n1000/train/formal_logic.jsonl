But since I is false (~I), H must be false to avoid contradiction (contrapositive: ~I ⊃ ~H).\n- So from (4) and (5), we can conclude ~H.\n\nThis is a direct inference by modus tollens on premise (4) with premise (5).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Check the answer choices**\n\nA) E ⊃ F  \n- This is the converse of (1). From ~E ⊃ ~F, the converse E ⊃ F is not necessarily true without additional info.\n\nB) F ⊃ G  \n- This is the converse of (2). From G ⊃ F, the converse F ⊃ G is not necessarily true without more info.\n\nC) H ⊃ ~E  \n- This is \"If H then not E\". We have H ∨ ~E (premise 3), but that does not imply H ⊃ ~E directly.\n\nD) ~H  \n- As reasoned above, from (4) and (5), we can infer ~H directly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe immediate consequence is ~H (option D), derived by modus tollens on (4) and (5).\n\n---\n\nAnswer: D"}
